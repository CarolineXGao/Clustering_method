Morales 2021a,Subtyping of Strengths and Difficulties in a Spanish Children Sample: A Latent Class Analysis.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.11.047,Morales A and Melero S and Tomczyk S and Espada JP and Orgilés M,2021,Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Externalizing and internalizing problems are frequent during childhood and are often comorbid. The current study aimed to explore subtypes of strengths and difficulties among Spanish children. METHODS: The Spanish version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was administered to 325 children (47.1% girls), aged 7-12 years (M = 9.64; SD = 1.34). Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was carried out to identify risk profiles in children according to their symptoms. ANOVA and multinomial logistic regression were performed to explore associations between latent classes and SDQ subscales, gender, age and number of siblings. RESULTS: Five latent classes were found: ""high difficulties"" (34.2%), ""internalizing"" (5.2%), ""externalizing"" (26.5%), ""hyperactive"" (14.5%), and ""well-adjusted"" (19.7%). Children belonging to ""High difficulties"" group showed the highest scores for emotional symptoms, conduct problems, and hyperactivity/inattention. The most prevalent pure profiles were the ""externalizing"" and ""hyperactivity"" group, which represent children with elevated behavioral problems, restlessness and distraction. Children in the ""internalizing"" class showed the highest risk of peer problems. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the diversity in the patterns of psychological strengths and difficulties and highlight the importance of early detection and intervention, especially in children's behavioral problems, in order to avoid vulnerability to comorbidity and more severe symptoms in the future."
Liu 2021a,Latent class analysis of depression and anxiety among medical students during COVID-19 epidemic.,http://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03459-w,Liu Z and Liu R and Zhang Y and Zhang R and Liang L and Wang Y and Wei Y and Zhu R and Wang F,2021,BMC psychiatry,"OBJECTIVE: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health emergency that has caused worldwide concern. The mental health of medical students under the COVID-19 epidemic has attracted much attention. This study aims to identify subgroups of medical students based on depression and anxiety and explore the influencing factors during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. METHODS: A total of 29,663 medical students were recruited during the epidemic of COVID-19 in China. Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD7) respectively. Latent class analysis was performed based on depression and anxiety symptoms in medical students. The latent class subtypes were compared using the chi-square test. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associations between identified classes and related factors. RESULTS: In this study, three distinct subgroups were identified, namely, the poor mental health group, the mild mental health group and the low symptoms group. The number of medical students in each class is 4325, 9321 and 16,017 respectively. The multinomial logistic regression results showed that compared with the low symptoms group, the factors influencing depression and anxiety in the poor mental health group and mild mental health group were sex, educational level, drinking, individual psychiatric disorders, family psychiatric disorders, knowledge of COVID-19, fear of being infected, and participate in mental health education on COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that latent class analysis can be used to categorize different medical students according to their depression and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak of COVID-19. The main factors influencing the poor mental health group and the mild mental health group are basic demographic characteristics, disease history, COVID-19 related factors and behavioural lifestyle. School administrative departments can carry out targeted psychological counseling according to different subgroups to promote the physical and mental health of medical students."
Weiss 2021,Symptom profiles of women at risk of mood disorders: A latent class analysis.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.013,Weiss SJ and Flynn H and Christian L and Hantsoo L and di Scalea TL and Kornfield SL and Muzik M and Simeonova DI and Cooper BA and Strahm A and Deligiannidis KM,2021,Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Depression is the leading cause of disease burden among women worldwide. However, an understanding of symptom profiles among women at risk of mood disorders is limited. We determined distinct profiles of affective symptoms among high risk women, along with their distinguishing characteristics. METHODS: Women were recruited from 17 clinical sites affiliated with the National Network of Depression Centers. They completed measures of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire - 9) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7) as well as questions regarding demographics, reproductive status, behavioral/mental health history, and life stress/adversity. Latent class analysis and multinomial logistic regression were used to identify and characterize symptom profiles. RESULTS: 5792 women participated, ages 18 to 90 (M = 38). Three latent classes were identified: generally asymptomatic (48%), elevated symptoms of comorbid anxiety and depression (16%), and somatic symptoms (36%). Financial security and greater social support were protective factors that distinguished asymptomatic women. The profile of the class with elevated anxiety/depressive symptoms constituted a complex mix of adverse social determinants and potentially heritable clinical features, including a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. Women in the 3rd latent class were characterized by menstrual irregularity and a stronger expression of neurovegetative symptoms, especially sleep disturbance and fatigue. LIMITATIONS: Limitations included less than optimal racial diversity of our sample and reliance on self-report. CONCLUSIONS: Different symptom profiles may reflect distinct subtypes of women at risk of mood disorders. Understanding the etiology and mechanisms underlying clinical and psychosocial features of these profiles can inform more precisely targeted interventions to address women's diverse needs."
Almeda 2021,Mental health planning at a very early stage of the COVID-19 crisis: a systematic review of online international strategies and recommendations.,http://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-03015-y,Almeda N and García-Alonso C and Salvador-Carulla L,2021,BMC psychiatry,"BACKGROUND: Mental health care systems have been dramatically affected by COVID-19. Containment measures have been imposed, with negative consequences on population mental health. Therefore, an increase in both symptomatology and mental disorder incidence is expected. This research aims to identify, describe and assess the empirical background on online strategies and recommendations developed by international organizations and governments to cope with the psychological impact of COVID-19 at a very early stage of the pandemic. METHODS: The PRISMA guidelines were adapted to review online documents. A new questionnaire was developed to identify the existence of common patterns in the selected documents. Questions were classified into three domains: COVID-19 information, mental health strategies and mental health recommendations. A two-step cluster analysis was carried out to highlight underlying behaviours in the data (patterns). The results are shown as spider graphs (pattern profiles) and conceptual maps (multidimensional links between questions). RESULTS: Twenty-six documents were included in the review. The questionnaire analysed document complexity and identified their common key mental health characteristics (i.e., does the respondent have the tools for dealing with stress, depression and anxiety?). Cluster analysis highlighted patterns from the questionnaire domains. Strong relationships between questions were identified, such as psychological tips for maintaining good mental health and coping with COVID-19 (question n° 4), describing some psychological skills to help people cope with anxiety and worry about COVID-19 (question n° 6) and promoting social connection at home (question n° 8). CONCLUSIONS: When fast results are needed to develop health strategies and policies, rapid reviews associated with statistical and graphical methods are essential. The results obtained from the proposed analytical procedure can be relevant to a) classify documents according to their complexity in structuring the information provided on how to cope with the psychological impact of COVID-19, b) develop new documents according to specific objectives matching population needs, c) improve document design to face unforeseen events, and d) adapt new documents to local situations. In this framework, the relevance of adapting e-mental health procedures to community mental health care model principles was highlighted, although some problems related to the digital gap must be considered."
Li 2021a,Effects of sources of social support and resilience on the mental health of different age groups during the COVID-19 pandemic.,http://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-03012-1,Li F and Luo S and Mu W and Li Y and Ye L and Zheng X and Xu B and Ding Y and Ling P and Zhou M and Chen X,2021,BMC psychiatry,"BACKGROUND: A pandemic is a very stressful event, especially for highly vulnerable people (e.g., older adults). The purpose of the current study was to investigate the main and interactive relationships of social support and resilience on individual mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic across three age groups: emerging adults, adults, and older adults. METHODS: A survey was conducted with 23,192 participants aged 18-85. Respondents completed a questionnaire, including items on the COVID-19-related support they perceived from different sources, the abbreviated version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and the Mental Health Inventory. RESULTS: Latent profile analysis identified five profiles of social support, and the patterns of potential profiles were similar in all groups. However, category distribution in the five profiles was significantly different among the age groups. Furthermore, analysis using the BCH command showed significant differences in mental health among these profiles. Lastly, interactive analyses indicated resilience had a positive relationship with mental health, and social support served as a buffer against the negative impact of low resilience on mental health. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides quantitative evidence for socioemotional selectivity theory (SST) and enables several practical implications for helping different age groups protecting mental health during pandemic."
Hai 2021,"Trends and correlates of Internet support group participation for mental health problems in the United States, 2004-2018.",http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.10.012,Hai AH and Lee CS and Oh S and Vaughn MG and Piñeros-Leaño M and Delva J and Salas-Wright CP,2021,Journal of psychiatric research,"PURPOSE: This study sought to examine the trends in Internet support group (ISG) participation among U.S. adults and to investigate the sociodemographic and behavioral health profiles of ISG participants. METHODS: Data was derived from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2004-2018, n = 625,883). Logistic regression was used to examine significance of trend year and correlates of ISG participation. Latent class analysis was conducted to identify subtypes of ISG participants. RESULTS: The proportion of U.S. adults participating in ISG increased significantly from 2.29% (2004-2007) to 3.55% (2016-2018). ISG participants were less likely to be male, 35 or older, be part of an ethnic/racial minority group, or have household incomes between $20,000 and $49,999. Black/African American participants and those classified as ""other"" race showed the largest percent increases, while Hispanics showed no change. ISG participants were more likely to have experienced a depressive episode and to have used cannabis. Three subtypes of ISG participants were identified, including the Lower Behavioral Health Risk group (62%), the Elevated Behavioral Health Risk group (24%), and the Depression, Cigarettes, and Cannabis group (14%). CONCLUSION: Overall, we found an increasing trend in seeking mental health care through ISG among US adults since the early 2000s. While disparities among some disadvantaged groups such as Blacks/African Americans and individuals with lower household income were diminishing, continuing efforts to engage men, older adults, and Hispanics in ISG are needed. This investigation also identified distinct subtypes of ISG participants and provides important implications for future research on ISG."
Morales 2021b,Internalizing and externalizing symptoms in Spanish children aged 6-8: Results of a latent profile analysis.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.066,Morales A and Rodríguez-Menchón M and Tomczyk S and Fernández-Martínez I and Orgilés M and Espada JP,2021,Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Internalizing and externalizing problems are widely addressed in research. However, most studies use variable-centred approaches and ignore the possible co-occurrence of both types of symptoms. This study aimed to identify homogeneous groups of children with similar psychological difficulties and strengths, using latent profile analysis as a person-centred approach. METHODS: The parents of 107 Spanish children aged 6 to 8 years completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). RESULTS: The results revealed the existence of four latent groups. The children who belonged to the high difficulties group showed the most severe symptoms in emotional problems, peer problems and hyperactivity. The children classified in the externalizing group showed high levels of hyperactivity, behavioral problems, and emotional problems. On another hand, the internalizing profile grouped children with emotional and peer problems. Finally, the well-adjusted group showed an adequate psychological adjustment in all evaluated variables. High difficulties were associated with lower educational attainment of their parents. LIMITATIONS: Data were reported from a single source of information, father or mother. Also, the socio-demographic variables that were related to each one of the four profiles only considered the age and educational level of the main informant. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that co-occurrence of symptoms is very high in young Spanish children. It is essential to carry out clinical assessments that include both types of symptoms. Considering externalization and internalization as independent and exclusive phenomena can compromise the effectiveness of psychological treatments and preventive programs."
Abbasi-Ghahramanloo 2021,Mental disorders pattern in staff of a military unit in Iran: the role of metabolic syndrome on latent class membership.,http://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03537-z,Abbasi-Ghahramanloo A and Bahadori M and Azad E and Dopeykar N and Mahdizadeh P and Vahedian Azimi A and Amini H,2021,BMC psychiatry,"INTRODUCTION: Mental disorders are among the most prevalent health problems of the adult population in the world. This study aimed to identify the subgroups of staff based on mental disorders and assess the independent role of metabolic syndrome (MetS) on the membership of participants in each latent class. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 694 staff of a military unit in Tehran in 2017. All staff of this military unit was invited to participate in this study. The collected data included demographic characteristics, anthropometric measures, blood pressure, biochemical parameters, and mental disorders. We performed latent class analysis using a procedure for latent class analysis (PROC LCA) in SAS to identify class membership of mental disorders using Symptom Checklist-90. RESULTS: Three latent classes were identified as healthy (92.7%), mild (4.9%), and severe (2.4%) mental disorders. Having higher age significantly decreased the odds of belonging to the mild class (adjusted OR (aOR = 0.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.05-0.83) compared to the healthy class. Also, obesity decreased the odds of membership in mild class (aOR = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.01-0.92) compared to healthy class. On the other hand, being female increased the odds of being in severe class (aOR = 9.76; 95% CI: 1.35-70.65) class in comparison to healthy class. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that 7.3% of staff fell under mild and severe classes. Considering educational workshops in the workplace about mental disorders could be effective in enhancing staff's knowledge of these disorders. Also, treatment of comorbid mental disorders may help reduce their prevalence and comorbidity."
Mundal 2021,Exploring patterns in psychiatric outpatients' preferences for involvement in decision-making: a latent class analysis approach.,http://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03137-x,Mundal I and Lara-Cabrera ML and Betancort M and De Las Cuevas C,2021,BMC psychiatry,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making (SDM), a collaborative approach that includes and respects patients' preferences for involvement in decision-making about their treatment, is increasingly advocated. However, in the practice of clinical psychiatry, implementing SDM seems difficult to accomplish. Although the number of studies related to psychiatric patients' preferences for involvement is increasing, studies have largely focused on understanding patients in public mental healthcare settings. Thus, investigating patient preferences for involvement in both public and private settings is of particular importance in psychiatric research. The objectives of this study were to identify different latent class typologies of patient preferences for involvement in the decision-making process, and to investigate how patient characteristics predict these typologies in mental healthcare settings. METHODS: We conducted latent class analysis (LCA) to identify groups of psychiatric outpatients with similar preferences for involvement in decision-making to estimate the probability that each patient belonged to a certain class based on sociodemographic, clinical and health belief variables. RESULTS: The LCA included 224 consecutive psychiatric outpatients' preferences for involvement in treatment decisions in public and private psychiatric settings. The LCA identified three distinct preference typologies, two collaborative and one passive, accounting for 78% of the variance. Class 1 (26%) included collaborative men aged 34-44 years with an average level of education who were treated by public services for a depressive disorder, had high psychological reactance, believed they controlled their disease and had a pharmacophobic attitude. Class 2 (29%) included collaborative women younger than 33 years with an average level of education, who were treated by public services for an anxiety disorder, had low psychological reactance or health control belief and had an unconcerned attitude toward medication. Class 3 (45%) included passive women older than 55 years with lower education levels who had a depressive disorder, had low psychological reactance, attributed the control of their disease to their psychiatrists and had a pharmacophilic attitude. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight how psychiatric patients vary in pattern of preferences for treatment involvement regarding demographic variables and health status, providing insight into understanding the pattern of preferences and comprising a significant advance in mental healthcare research."
Soydas 2021,Psychopathology in a treatment-seeking sample of homicidally bereaved individuals: Latent class analysis.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.05.026,Soydas S and Smid GE and Lenferink LIM and Djelantik AAMJ and Goodfellow B and Wilson R and Boelen PA,2021,Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Violently bereaved individuals are at increased risk of developing severe and comorbid disorders. Comorbidity may increase psychiatric symptom severity and suicide risk and decrease psychosocial functioning compared with having one disorder. We aimed to identify subgroups of individuals with similar symptom patterns, describe prevalence rates and overall levels of prolonged grief disorder (PGD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) per class, and explore associations between class membership and personal and homicide related variables. METHODS: We investigated the comorbidity of symptoms of PGD, PTSD, MDD, and GAD in a sample of 923 treatment-seeking homicidally bereaved individuals by deploying latent class analysis. RESULTS: Three subgroups were identified: (i) a moderate distress, low depression class (12.4%), (ii) a high distress, moderate depression class (42.7%), and (iii) a high distress and high depression class (45.0%). Prevalence rates and total scores of the questionnaires followed the pattern of iii ≥ ii ≥ i (ps ≤ .001). Being female and having experienced prior life stress distinguished between all classes (ps ≤ .05). LIMITATIONS: The data-driven analytic approach and reliance on self-reported routine outcome monitoring data limit the generalizability and validity of the study. Strengths include the large sample size and the inclusion of four measures in a treatment-seeking, violently bereaved sample. CONCLUSIONS: Classes were most clearly distinguishable based on symptom severity, indicating high comorbidity following bereavement by homicide. This argues for an integrated treatment that targets different complaints simultaneously rather than successively."
Li 2021b,Snapshot of a social movement: Mental health and protest classes in Hong Kong.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.111,Li AWY and Chak WH and Yuen KSL,2021,Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Popular protests have broken out worldwide, particularly in the last few years. In 2019, numerous demonstrations against an extradition bill occurred in Hong Kong until pandemic restrictions were imposed. The policing response relied heavily on methods such as batons, tear gas and rubber bullets. Given the relevance for other geographical contexts, the current study investigated the mental health impacts on protest participants and spillover to community members. METHODS: Surveys were disseminated on social media in August and October 2019 to collect demographics, political views, protest participation, exposure to (protest-related) potentially traumatic events (PTEs) and mental health symptoms. A latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted using demographic data and inter-class differences in PTEs and mental health symptoms were examined. RESULTS: There were 37,541 (59.8% female) and 40,703 (50.0% female) responses in August and October. Respondents, even those with low participation, reported significant levels of depression, anxiety, and symptoms of traumatic stress (STS). The LCA suggested a 5-class solution (youth, allies, supporters, sympathizers, and frontliners). Mental health symptoms and PTEs varied with class membership, with 50.8% of frontliners reporting severe STS. LIMITATIONS: The non-random sampling and self-reported measures may over-estimate the prevalence of mental distress in the wider population. CONCLUSIONS: Large numbers of pro-democracy supporters in Hong Kong reported high rates of depression, anxiety and STS during mass protests. Younger and more heavily involved respondents faced the highest mental health risks, however elevated rates were also observed for respondents with low participation."
Schmid 2021,The screen for cognitive impairment in psychiatry (SCIP) as a routinely applied screening tool: pathology of acute psychiatric inpatients and cluster analysis.,http://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03508-4,Schmid P and Czekaj A and Frick J and Steinert T and Purdon SE and Uhlmann C,2021,BMC psychiatry,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive dysfunction has been reported in acute psychiatric patients for a long time. The detection of cognitive deficits is crucial both for clinical treatment and for predicting the psychosocial functional level in the further course of the disease. The SCIP is a well-evaluated screening instrument for the examination of cognitive performance in psychiatric patients. We recently integrated the SCIP into our routine admission and discharge assessments on two inpatient wards, and we examined the cognitive profiles of patients with psychotic and affective disorders over the course of their admission. METHODS: Shortly after admission, and prior to discharge, patients were routinely referred for examination with the SCIP. A total of 529 assessments were completed on admission, and 227 returned for SCIP at the time of discharge. After standardization of the test results against a normative sample, we examined the normalized test values in terms of percentages of pathological cognitive performance based on the total SCIP score, and each of the SCIP subscale scores. We conducted cluster analysis to identify cognitive subgroups within the clinical sample. RESULTS: More than 70% of the SCIP results on admission were pathological. At discharge, improvements were observed, especially on tests with attention and speed components. Cluster analysis identified two groups. The cluster with chronic patients showed poorer results at admission, but greater improvement and reached the level of the others at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The SCIP appears to have value in routine diagnostic assessments, and in the quantification of improvements in cognitive performance during an inpatient stay. The greatest benefit was observed in chronically ill patients with many previous stays. TRIAL REGISTRATION: DRKS00019825 (retrospectively registered on 03.12.2019)."

Recent studies have suggested more heterogeneous mental health outcomes than the initially identified four adjustment trajectories. To explore this heterogeneity, we investigated the after-trauma adjustment patterns of psychopathology based on retrospective lifetime data. This was first carried out on the PTSD symptoms (PTSS, including no symptoms, few symptoms, partial and full PTSD), and secondly together with their post-trauma comorbidities. METHODS: Data of trauma and the post-trauma mental disorders were collected for a large and randomly selected community sample, resulting in a N = 960 trauma-exposed subsample. Pattern recognition as carried out by latent class analysis (LCA) was implemented on this subsample. LCA was first exploited to identify the potential trajectory patterns of PTSS and next to explore the patterns of mental adjustments when additional post-trauma comorbid disorders, such as anxiety, mood and substance use disorders, were assessed. RESULTS: Four PTSS trajectory patterns were found, namely resilient, chronic, recovered, and delayed onset, consistent with findings from longitudinal PTSD studies. When post-trauma comorbidities were evaluated, other than the trajectory pattern of delayed onset which retained a low comorbidity profile, the other three split respectively and paired up with either low, moderate or high comorbidity profile. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health outcomes after trauma exposure were considerably more complex than the four previously established adjustment trajectories. Here, we uncovered additional and more heterogeneous adjustment patterns comprised of PTSS trajectories and post-trauma comorbidity profiles."
Rosellini 2021,Latent classes of posttraumatic psychiatric comorbidity in the general population.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.013,Rosellini AJ and Szentkúti P and Horváth-Puhó E and Smith ML and Galatzer-Levy I and Lash TL and Galea S and Schnurr PP and Sørensen HT and Gradus JL,2021,Journal of psychiatric research,"Some narrow patterns of posttraumatic psychiatric comorbidity are well-established (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder and substance use). However, broad multi-diagnosis profiles of posttraumatic comorbidity are poorly characterized. The goal of the current study was to use latent class analysis (LCA) to identify profiles of posttraumatic psychopathology from 11 International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) diagnostic categories (e.g., stress, substance, depressive, psychosis, personality). Danish national registries were used to identify 166,539 individuals (median age = 41 years, range = <1 to >100) who experienced a traumatic event between 1994 and 2016 and were diagnosed with one or more mental disorders within 5 years. Two through 14-class LCA solutions were evaluated. A 13-class solution (a) provided the best fit, with the Bayes and Akaike Information Criteria reaching a minimum, (b) was broadly consistent with prior LCA studies, and (c) included several novel classes reflecting differential patterns of posttraumatic psychopathology. Three classes were characterized by high comorbidity: broad high comorbidity (M # diagnoses = 4.3), depression with stress/substance use/personality/neurotic disorders (M# diagnoses = 3.8), and substance use with personality/stress/psychotic disorders (M # diagnoses = 3.1). The other 10 classes were characterized by distinct patterns of mild comorbidity or negligible comorbidity. Compared to the mild and negligible comorbidity classes, individuals in high comorbidity classes were younger, had lower income, and had more pre-event psychiatric disorders. Results suggest that several different comorbidity patterns should be assessed when studying and treating posttraumatic psychopathology."
Coid 2021a,Confirming diagnostic categories within a depression continuum: Testing extra-linearity of risk factors and a latent class analysis.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.010,Coid JW and Zhang Y and Yu H and Li X and Tang W and Wang Q and Deng W and Guo W and Zhao L and Ma X and Meng Y and Li M and Wang H and Chen T and Li T,2021,Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Dimensions are recommended as replacements for diagnostic categories of depression, but clinicians continue to use categories. Categories are appropriate if major, underlying changes in symptom structure occur above a clinical cut-off on a depression continuum. METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys of Chinese undergraduates (n = 39,446) 2014-2018 measured self-reported depressive symptoms, associated psychopathology and etiological risk factors using standardised instruments. We created a continuum using PHQ-9 scores and tested linear and extra-linear contrasts in associated psychopathology, and etiology. We carried out latent class analyses (LCA). RESULTS: Most symptoms showed linear increase, but depressed mood, anhedonia, and suicidal ideation showed marked increase at the severe end of the continuum. There was extra-linear increase in associated psychotic symptoms, other psychopathology, age, low family income, chronic pain and physical illness, childhood physical and sexual abuse, and neglect. Four LCs corresponding to Melancholic, Severe melancholic, Non-melancholic, and Mild depression were confirmed, but only above a clinical cut-off along the continuum. Etiological risk factors did not differentiate between classes but showed overall dramatic increase in impact above threshold of clinical severity. LIMITATIONS: Only one self-report instrument was used (PHQ-9) to measure depression and diagnoses were not validated by clinical interviews. CONCLUSIONS: Categories are necessary to describe the dramatic changes in underlying structure and symptom associations above a clinical threshold of severity. These result from extra-linear impact of etiological risk factors at the severe end of the depression continuum. Although the study confirmed melancholic and non-melancholic subtypes, further investigation should investigate etiological factors that determine this subdivision."
Panza 2021,Subgroups of comorbid PTSD and AUD in U.S. military veterans predict differential responsiveness to two integrated treatments: A latent class analysis.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.061,Panza KE and Kline AC and Norman GJ and Pitts M and Norman SB,2021,Journal of psychiatric research,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) frequently co-occur. Integrated treatments are effective, but not all patients respond and predicting outcome remains difficult. In this study, latent class analysis (LCA) identified symptom-based subgroups of comorbid PTSD/AUD among 119 veterans with PTSD/AUD from a randomized controlled trial of integrated exposure therapy (I-PE) versus integrated coping skills therapy (I-CS). Multilevel models compared subgroups on PTSD severity and percentage of heavy drinking days at post-treatment and 3- and 6-month follow-up. LCA revealed three subgroups best fit the data: Moderate PTSD/Low AUD Impairment (21%), High PTSD/High AUD Impairment (48%), and Low PTSD/High AUD Impairment (31%). There was a three-way interaction between time, treatment condition, and subgroup in predicting PTSD outcomes (p < .05). For the Moderate PTSD/Low AUD Impairment class, outcomes at post-treatment and 3-months were similar (ds = 0.17, 0.55), however I-PE showed greater reductions at 6-months (d = 1.36). For the High PTSD/High AUD Impairment class, I-PE demonstrated better post-treatment (d = 0.83) but comparable follow-up (ds = -0.18, 0.49) outcomes. For the Low PTSD/High AUD Impairment class, I-PE demonstrated stronger outcomes at every timepoint (ds = 0.82-1.15). Heavy drinking days declined significantly through follow-up, with an effect of subgroup, but not treatment, on timing of response. This was the first study modeling how PTSD and AUD symptoms might cluster together in a treatment sample of veterans with PTSD/AUD. Symptom-based subgroups show promise in helping understand variability in treatment response among patients with PTSD/AUD and deserve further study."
Schuler 2021,Associations between depression subtype and functional impairment and treatment utilization in a national sample of adolescents.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.03.018,Schuler MS and Gilman SE and Burns RM and Roth E and Breslau J,2021,Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Prior studies have characterized distinct major depressive episode (MDE) subtypes among adults, yet limited evidence exists regarding variation in MDE during adolescence. METHODS: Using 2008-2016 National Survey of Drug Use and Health data, latent class analysis (LCA) was used to characterize depression subtypes (based on symptom presentation) among 9,896 youth ages 12-17 with recent first-onset MDE. Logistic regression was used to estimate associations of MDE subtype with functional outcomes and treatment utilization, adjusting for demographic characteristics and depression severity (i.e., number of MDE diagnostic criteria and recurrence status) RESULTS: A 5-class LCA model provided optimal fit. Three distinct categories of MDE symptoms generally clustered together, which we termed ""somatic,"" ""cognitive,"" and ""self-worth;"" classes were differentiated by distinct combinations of symptoms across these 3 categories. Subtypes were characterized as: Highly Symptomatic (39% of youth); Somatic & Cognitive (24%), Somatic (22%), Diffuse Symptoms (8%), and Somatic & Self-Worth (6%). The majority of youth reported at least moderate impairment across multiple domains; subtype was a significant predictor of functional impairment. Only 34% of youth received any past-year depression-related treatment; treatment utilization was significantly higher for MDE subtypes with the highest prevalences of suicidal ideation. LIMITATIONS: Due to cross-sectional data, we cannot establish causal directionality. CONCLUSIONS: Subtype was significantly predictive of functional impairment and treatment utilization, above and beyond number of MDE diagnostic criteria or recurrence status. Understanding distinct profiles of adolescent depression, as well as potential differential associations with impairment, can inform prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of depression among youth."
Stein 2021,Mental health mediators of subjective cognitive concerns among World Trade Center responders.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.05.081,Stein CR and Cooney ML and Frank B and Bender HA and Winkel G and Lucchini RG,2021,Journal of psychiatric research,"Decline in cognitive functioning among rescue and recovery workers who responded in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, World Trade Center (WTC) attacks is of emerging interest. Responders are vulnerable to cognitive decline from exposure to airborne toxins present at the WTC site, as well as from WTC-related mental and physical health conditions. To better understand the relationship between occupational WTC exposure, mental health, physical health and subjective cognitive functioning, we examined the mediating role of health status in the association between exposure and subjective cognitive concerns in a multi-site, longitudinal investigation of the WTC General Responder cohort (n = 16,380 responders; n = 58,575 visits) for the period 2002-2015. Through latent class analyses, we identified a four-level marker of cognitive concerns based on information from a Self-Administered Mental Health Questionnaire. Using generalized linear mixed models with random intercepts, we observed that a higher intensity WTC exposure composite was associated with greater cognitive concerns, and that this association was operating almost entirely through mental health comorbidities, not physical health comorbidities. In fully adjusted models, the inclusion of probable depression, anxiety, PTSD and use of psychotropic medications attenuated the association between highest WTC exposure and greatest cognitive concerns. Physical health did not appear to be on the pathway between WTC exposure and cognitive concerns. Understanding the underlying sources of cognitive concerns may help identify vulnerable members of the General Responder cohort and potentially aid clinical decision-making, such as treatment choice and enhanced screening options. Earlier diagnosis and symptom treatment may help preserve functional independence."
Butcher 2021,Screening male prisoners for depression and anxiety with the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 at NHS Healthcheck: patterns of symptoms and caseness threshold.,http://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03453-2,Butcher E and Packham C and Williams M and Miksza J and Kaul A and Khunti K and Morriss R,2021,BMC psychiatry,"BACKGROUND: Screening for depression and anxiety disorders has been proposed in prison populations but little is known about caseness thresholds on commonly used self-report measures in relation to core symptoms, risk factors and symptom patterns. METHOD: A cross-sectional prevalence survey measured depression and anxiety caseness (threshold scores > 10 and > 15 on PHQ-9 and GAD-7 and diagnostic algorithm on PHQ-9) in 1205 male prisoners aged 35-74 years eligible for an NHS Healthcheck from six English prisons. Caseness scores were compared with the presence or absence of daily core symptoms of depression and generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), demographic, prison and cardiovascular risk factors. Cluster analysis was applied to PHQ-9 and GAD-7 items in prisoners scoring > 10 on PHQ-9. RESULTS: 453(37.6%) and 249(20.7%) prisoners scored > 10 and > 15 respectively on PHQ-9; 216 (17.9%) had a depressive episode on the PHQ-9 algorithm; 378(31.4%) and 217(18.0%) scored > 10 and > 15 on GAD-7 respectively. Daily core items for depression were scored in 232(56.2%) and 139(74.3%) prisoners reaching > 10 and > 15 respectively on PHQ-9; daily core anxiety items in 282(74.9%) and 179(96.3%) reaching > 10 and > 15 on GAD-7. Young age, prison and previous high alcohol intake were associated with > 15 on the PHQ-9. Cluster analysis showed a cluster with core symptoms of depression, slowness, restlessness, suicidality, poor concentration, irritability or fear. Altered appetite, poor sleep, lack of energy, guilt or worthlessness belonged to other clusters and may not be indicative of depression. CONCLUSIONS: In male prisoners > 35 years, a score of > 10 on the PHQ-9 over diagnoses depressive episodes but a score of > 10 on the GAD-7 may detect cases of GAD more efficiently. Further research utilising standardised psychiatric interviews is required to determine whether the diagnostic algorithm, a higher cut-off on the PHQ-9 or the profile of symptoms on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 used singly or in combination may be used to screen depressive episodes efficiently in prisoners."
Ayesa-Arriola 2021,Dissecting the functional outcomes of first episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a 10-year follow-up study in the PAFIP cohort.,http://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291719003179,Ayesa-Arriola R and Ortíz-García de la Foz V and Martínez-García O and Setién-Suero E and Ramírez ML and Suárez-Pinilla P and Mayoral-van Son J and Vázquez-Bourgon J and Juncal-Ruiz M and Gómez-Revuelta M and Tordesillas-Gutiérrez D and Crespo-Facorro B,2021,Psychological medicine,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the current study was to examine the heterogeneity of functional outcomes in first episode psychosis (FEP) patients and related clinical, neurocognitive and sociodemographic factors using a cluster analytic approach. METHOD: A large sample of FEP patients (N = 209) was functionally reassessed 10 years after the first contact with an early intervention service. Multiple baseline, 3-year and 10-year follow-up variables were explored. RESULTS: The cluster analysis emphasized the existence of six independent clusters of functioning: one cluster was normal overall (42.16%), two clusters showed moderate interpersonal (9.63%) or instrumental (12.65%) deficits, two clusters showed more severe interpersonal (12.05%) or interpersonal and instrumental (13.85%) deficits and there was a significantly overall impaired cluster (9.63%). Cluster comparisons showed that several baseline and follow-up factors were differentially involved in functional outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrated that distinct clusters of functioning in FEP patients can be identified. The fact that a variety of profiles was observed contributes to a better understanding of the nature of the heterogeneity characterizing FEP patients and has clinical implications for developing individualized treatment plans."
Valli 2021,Cognitive heterogeneity in the offspring of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder: a cluster analysis across family risk.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.090,Valli I and Serna E and Borràs R and Ilzarbe D and Baeza I and Picouto MD and Baltasar I and Moreno D and Bernardo M and Young AH and Vieta E and Sugranyes G and Castro-Fornieles J,2021,Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Neurocognitive impairment is considered to lie on a continuum of severity across schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP), possibly reflecting a gradient of neurodevelopmental load. Cluster analyses have identified different levels of impairment across the two disorders, from none to widespread and severe. We for the first time used this approach to examine cognitive function pooling together children and adolescents at familial risk of SZ or BP. METHODS: 220 participants, 49 offspring of individuals with schizophrenia (SZO), 90 offspring of individuals with bipolar disorder (BPO) and 81 offspring of healthy control parents (HC), aged 6 to 17 years, underwent a comprehensive clinical and cognitive assessment. Cognitive measures were used to group SZO and BPO using K-means clustering. Cognitive performance within each of the clusters was compared to that of HC and clinical variables were compared between clusters. RESULTS: We identified three cognitive subgroups: a moderate impairment group, a mild impairment group, and a cognitively intact group. Both SZO and BPO were represented in each of the clusters, yet not evenly, with a larger proportion of the SZO in the moderately impaired cluster, but also a subgroup of BPO showing moderate cognitive dysfunction. LIMITATIONS: Participants have yet to reach the age of onset for the examined disorders. CONCLUSIONS: The findings point to a range of neurodevelopmental loadings across youth at familial risk of both SZ and BP. They have therefore important implications for the stratification of cognitive functioning and the possibility to tailor interventions to individual levels of impairment."
Krona 2021,Patterns of Lifetime Criminality in Mentally Disordered Offenders - Findings From a Nationally Representative Cohort.,http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.564171,Krona H and Anckarsäter H and Nilsson T and Hofvander B,2021,Frontiers in psychiatry,"Background: Treatment of mentally disordered offenders (MDOs) is challenging as their behavior and clinical conditions can be traced to a complex constellation of major mental disorders, substance use and antisocial lifestyle. Finding subgroups of these offenders, which could guide treatment and risk assessment, is desirable. There are few long-term, prospective studies of risk factors for persistent criminal behavior among MDOs. Aims: The aims are (1) to provide a map of lifetime criminality in MDOs, (2) to identify subgroups of offenders, and (3), if such clusters exist, to test whether they differ in lifetime criminality and patterns of negative events during in-patient treatment. Methods: Background data on all offenders from the Malmö University Hospital catchment area sentenced to forensic psychiatric in-patient treatment 1999-2005 (n = 125) was collected. Data on negative events during treatment (violence, threats, absconding and substance use) from date of admittance until discharge or until June 30, 2008 was gathered. Court decisions for 118 of the cohort-individuals were collected from the 1(st) of January 1973 until December 31, 2013. We used hierarchical cluster analysis to identify subgroups and MANOVA-analysis to examine differences between these clusters on lifetime criminality variables and negative events. A MANCOVA was used to control for time in treatment. Results: The cohort was sentenced to a total of 3,380 crimes (944 violent) during the study period. Median age at first crime was 20 years (range 15-72), and at first violent crime 27 years (range 15-72). A subgroup (n = 26) was characterized by childhood adversities, neurodevelopmental disorders and later substance use disorders and was more often associated with substance-related crimes, financial crimes and lower age at first crime. During treatment, this cluster showed higher rates of substance use and threats. When controlling for treatment time, no differences in negative events were found. Conclusions: This study replicated findings from prison populations of the existence of a more criminally persistent phenotype characterized by early-onset neurodevelopmental and behavior disorders, childhood adversities and later substance use disorders. We did not find this cluster of variables to be related to negative events during inpatient treatment when controlling for length of stay."
Wahid 2021,"A distress-continuum, disorder-threshold model of depression: a mixed-methods, latent class analysis study of slum-dwelling young men in Bangladesh.",http://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03259-2,Wahid SS and Sandberg J and Sarker M and Arafat ASME and Apu AR and Rabbani A and Colón-Ramos U and Kohrt BA,2021,BMC psychiatry,"BACKGROUND: Binary categorical approaches to diagnosing depression have been widely criticized due to clinical limitations and potential negative consequences. In place of such categorical models of depression, a 'staged model' has recently been proposed to classify populations into four tiers according to severity of symptoms: 'Wellness;' 'Distress;' 'Disorder;' and 'Refractory.' However, empirical approaches to deriving this model are limited, especially with populations in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: A mixed-methods study using latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted to empirically test non-binary models to determine the application of LCA to derive the 'staged model' of depression. The study population was 18 to 29-year-old men (n = 824) from an urban slum of Bangladesh, a low resource country in South Asia. Subsequently, qualitative interviews (n = 60) were conducted with members of each latent class to understand experiential differences among class members. RESULTS: The LCA derived 3 latent classes: (1) Severely distressed (n = 211), (2) Distressed (n = 329), and (3) Wellness (n = 284). Across the classes, some symptoms followed a continuum of severity: 'levels of strain', 'difficulty making decisions', and 'inability to overcome difficulties.' However, more severe symptoms such as 'anhedonia', 'concentration issues', and 'inability to face problems' only emerged in the severely distressed class. Qualitatively, groups were distinguished by severity of tension, a local idiom of distress. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that LCA can be a useful empirical tool to inform the 'staged model' of depression. In the findings, a subset of distress symptoms was continuously distributed, but other acute symptoms were only present in the class with the highest distress severity. This suggests a distress-continuum, disorder-threshold model of depression, wherein a constellation of impairing symptoms emerge together after exceeding a high level of distress, i.e., a tipping point of tension heralds a host of depression symptoms."
Yoon 2021,Clinical profiles of college student patients in a psychiatric hospital.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.05.069,Yoon S and Nevins CM and Liu CH and Chen JA and Pinder-Amaker SL,2021,Journal of psychiatric research,"College students represent a significant portion of patients in a psychiatric hospital. However, limited previous research has examined the clinical profiles of this unique population, especially across both inpatient and outpatient settings. To better understand college student mental health, the current study explored the potentially heterogeneous groups of students admitted to inpatient or treated in outpatient units in a large psychiatric hospital. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to identify latent clusters based on mental health-related struggles, measured by the Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms-34, a measure specifically designed to assess college students. LPA results identified five underlying clusters: 1) negative affect (NA); 2) NA/alcohol struggles; 3) NA/eating concerns; 4) general distress; and 5) low clinical scores. Students who reported comorbid alcohol-related struggles or eating concerns with negative affect showed the greatest overall distress. The NA/alcohol struggles group was more likely to be inpatient than outpatient. Notably, the NA/eating concerns group, one of the most distressed groups, did not significantly predict higher levels of care, indicating that outpatient students may struggle as greatly as inpatient students. The current study provides new insights into the clinical profiles of the important, yet traditionally understudied, population of college students in both inpatient and outpatient psychiatric hospital settings. Future research on college student patients is imperative to better understand college student mental health from both hospital and university perspectives."

These conditions are prevalent, highly heterogeneous, under-researched, and under-treated. In order for progress to be made in optimally classifying and treating these conditions, it is necessary to identify meaningful subtypes. 279 adults (100 with TTM, 81 with SPD, 40 with both TTM and SPD, and 58 controls) were recruited for an international, multi-center between-group comparison using mixture modeling, with stringent correction for multiple comparisons. The main outcome measure was to examine distinct subtypes (aka latent classes) across all study participants using item-level data from gold-standard instruments assessing detailed clinical measures. Mixture models identified 3 subtypes of TTM (entropy 0.98) and 2 subtypes of SPD (entropy 0.99) independent of the control group. Significant differences between these classes were identified on measures of disability, automatic and focused symptoms, perfectionism, trait impulsiveness, and inattention and hyperactivity. These data indicate the existence of three separate subtypes of TTM, and two separate subtypes of SPD, which are distinct from controls. The identified clinical differences between these latent classes may be useful to tailor future treatments by focusing on particular traits. Future work should examine whether these latent subtypes relate to treatment outcomes, or particular psychobiological findings using neuroimaging techniques."
Booij 2021,Dynamic time warp analysis of individual symptom trajectories in depressed patients treated with electroconvulsive therapy.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.06.068,Booij MM and van Noorden MS and van Vliet IM and Ottenheim NR and van der Wee NJA and Van Hemert AM and Giltay EJ,2021,Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Although electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) effectively improves severity scores of depression, its effects on its individual symptoms has scarcely been studied. We aimed to study which depressive symptom trajectories dynamically cluster together in individuals as well as groups of patients during ECT using Dynamic Time Warp (DTW) analysis. METHODS: We analysed the standardized weekly scores on the 25-item abbreviated version of the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS) in depressed patients before and during their first six weeks of ECT treatment. DTW analysis was used to analyse the (dis)similarity of time series of items scores at the patient level (300 'DTW distances' per patient) as well as on the group level. Hierarchical cluster, network, and Distatis analyses yielded symptom dimensions. RESULTS: We included 133 patients, 64.7% female, with an average age of 60.4 years (SD 15.1). Individual DTW distance matrices and networks revealed marked differences in hierarchical and network clusters among patients. Based on cluster analyses of the aggregated matrices, four symptom clusters emerged. In patients who reached remission, the average DTW distance between their symptoms was significantly smaller than non-remitters, reflecting denser symptom networks in remitters than non-remitters (p=0.04). LIMITATIONS: The assessments were done only weekly during the first six weeks of ECT treatment. The use of individual items of the abbreviated CPRS may have led to measurement error as well as floor and ceiling effects. CONCLUSION: DTW offers an efficient new approach to analyse symptom trajectories within individuals as well as groups of patients, aiding personalized medicine of psychopathology."

This study aimed to identify cognitive subgroups in a large sample of FEP using a clustering approach with healthy controls as a reference group, subsequently linking cognitive subgroups to clinical and functional outcomes. METHODS: 204 FEP patients were included. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using baseline brief assessment of cognition in schizophrenia (BACS). Cognitive subgroups were compared to 40 controls and linked to longitudinal clinical and functional outcomes (PANSS, GAF, self-reported WHODAS 2.0) up to 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: Three distinct cognitive clusters emerged: relative to controls, we found one cluster with preserved cognition (n = 76), one moderately impaired cluster (n = 74) and one severely impaired cluster (n = 54). Patients with severely impaired cognition had more severe clinical symptoms at baseline, 6- and 12-month follow-up as compared to patients with preserved cognition. General functioning (GAF) in the severely impaired cluster was significantly lower than in those with preserved cognition at baseline and showed trend-level effects at 6- and 12-month follow-up. No significant differences in self-reported functional outcome (WHODAS 2.0) were present. CONCLUSIONS: Current results demonstrate the existence of three distinct cognitive subgroups, corresponding with clinical outcome at baseline, 6- and 12-month follow-up. Importantly, the cognitively preserved subgroup was larger than the severely impaired group. Early identification of discrete cognitive profiles can offer valuable information about the clinical outcome but may not be relevant in predicting self-reported functional outcomes."

Using cluster analytical techniques, this study sought to identify cognitive clusters in a sample of first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients and examine clinical and developmental differences across the resultant groups. METHODS: In total, 105 FEP patients in the University of California Los Angeles Aftercare Research Program were assessed for cognition, symptoms and premorbid developmental adjustment. Hierarchical cluster analysis with Ward's method and squared Euclidean distance was conducted, confirmed by discriminant function analysis and optimised with k-means clustering. The stability of the solution was evaluated through split-sample (random, 80 and 70% samples) and alternate method (average linkage method) replication via Cohen's κ analysis. Controlling for multiple comparisons, one-way analysis of variances examined group differences in symptom severity and premorbid adjustment. RESULTS: Three groups were identified: severely impaired (n = 27), moderately impaired (n = 41) and relatively intact (n = 37). There were no significant differences in symptom severity across the groups. Significant differences were observed for scholastic performance at three different developmental stages: childhood, early adolescence and late adolescence, with the relatively intact group demonstrating significantly better scholastic performance at all three stages than both the moderately impaired and severely impaired groups (who did not significantly differ from each other). CONCLUSIONS: The findings add to growing evidence that cognitive clusters in FEP mirror that of later-stage schizophrenia. They also suggest that premorbid scholastic performance may not just be a risk factor for developing schizophrenia, but is also related to cognitive impairment severity and potentially to prognosis."
Pons 2020,Where Did All the Sport Go? Negative Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Life-Spheres and Mental Health of Spanish Young Athletes.,http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.611872,Pons J and Ramis Y and Alcaraz S and Jordana A and Borrueco M and Torregrossa M,2020,Frontiers in psychology,"During the 2020, the pandemic caused by the massive spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19) resulted in a global crisis. In Spain, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a lockdown for almost 100 days and forced the sudden stop of sport practices and competitions. This interruption had a negative impact on high-level athletes' mental health. However, its impact on young athletes, who are intrinsically developing a high-demanding dual career, remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed at (1) describing and characterizing the general impact that COVID-19 lockdown had on Spanish young athletes' life-spheres and mental health, and (2) identifying different profiles of athletes regarding life-conditions and sport-related variables. A sample of 544 young athletes (M = 15.9; SD = 1.51) participated in this study. Measures included life-conditions and sport-related information along with the Holistic Monitoring Questionnaire (HMQ) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). After the screening and description of the data, profiles were defined using a two-level cluster analysis using HMQ and GHQ-12 subscales. We explored differences in demographic and sports information between profiles using MANOVA and subsequent ANOVA. Results suggest a general negative impact of COVID-19 on young athletes' life-spheres and mental health, but with three different clusters regarding the degree of such impact. Cluster 1 grouped the 54.78% of the sample and exhibited a low negative impact of COVID-19 lockdown on life-spheres and few mental health issues. Cluster 2 grouped a 29.96% of the participants who reported a medium negative impact on life-spheres and moderate mental health issues. Cluster 3 represented 15.26% of the sample including participants who showed a high negative impact of the COVID-19 lockdown with high mental health issues. The paradigmatic participant in this third group would be a female student-athlete from a medium or low socioeconomic status with high academic demands and poor or inexistent training conditions during lockdown. Current findings emphasize the need to pay attention to young athletes' mental health and suggest possible influencing contextual variables. We suggest some applied recommendations aimed at helping clubs and sports institutions to mitigate the negative effects of such difficult circumstances on athletes' mental health."

AIMS: To (1) identify profiles of complex childhood trauma amongst men and women with major depression, (2) examine patterns of service access and treatment or maladaptive coping (drug misuse, alcohol abuse or suicidality), and (3) associations with socio-economic/demographic characteristics, comorbid PTSD, anxiety/mood disorders and perceived social support. METHOD: Analysis of Wave 3 of the national epidemiologic survey on alcohol and related conditions (NESARC) (2012-2013). We use the Latent Class Analysis 3-step approach in Mplus to examine individual differences in childhood experiences and coping behaviour. We examined both (a) the inter-relationship of this patterning, and (b) the extent to which proactive and maladaptive coping are associated with socio-economic/demographic characteristics, comorbid PTSD, anxiety disorders and perceived social support. RESULTS: a diagnosis of Major Depression was recorded for 7432 people, two thirds of whom reported a history of complex childhood trauma. Maladaptive coping is associated with the most severe trauma groups, comorbid PTSD, dysthymia, and anxiety disorders. CONCLUSION: Given the evidence of the current study, suggesting a poorer treatment course for depression in adults with complex childhood trauma, early screening for a trauma history will facilitate preventive efforts before onset of depression, possibly mitigating a poorer treatment course."

Few studies have compared trajectories of depression and anxiety among clinically ill. We aimed to identify specific trajectories of depression, and anxiety and predictors of trajectory membership. METHODS: Latent growth mixture modelling was carried out on data from the IPS-MA trial (n = 261), a supported employment intervention for people with mood or anxiety, to identify trajectories of depression and anxiety. Logistic regression was used to estimate predictors for trajectory membership. Associations between trajectory class and remission of comorbid depression or anxiety and return to work were also tested. RESULTS: We identified three trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms respectively; moderate-decreasing (60%), moderate-stable (26%), and low-stable (14%) depression and mild-decreasing (59%), moderate-decreasing (33%), and moderate-stable (8%) anxiety. The depression model showed low precision in class separation (entropy 0.66), hence, predictors of class membership were not estimated. For anxiety, lower age and higher levels of depressive symptoms were associated with a less desirable trajectory. Remission of comorbid depressive symptoms after two years differed significantly between classes (p < 0.000). Fewer had returned to work in the two moderate classes compared to the mild-decreasing anxiety class. LIMITATIONS: Depression model not reliable. Only 80% of participants from original study included. Not able to distinguish between anxiety disorders. CONCLUSION: Trajectories of anxiety confirm that, even after two years, a rather large proportion in the moderate-stable class had symptoms of moderate anxiety, moderate comorbid depressive symptoms, and less probability of having returned to work.

We aimed to identify PTSD subtypes and evaluate their associations with genetic risk factors, types of stress exposures, comorbidity, and course of PTSD. METHODS: Data came from a prospective study of three U.S. Army Brigade Combat Teams that deployed to Afghanistan in 2012. Soldiers with probable PTSD (PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition ≥31) at three months postdeployment comprised the sample (N = 423) for latent profile analysis using Gaussian mixture modeling and PTSD symptom ratings as indicators. PTSD profiles were compared on polygenic risk scores (derived from external genomewide association study summary statistics), experiences during deployment, comorbidity at three months postdeployment, and persistence of PTSD at nine months postdeployment. RESULTS: Latent profile analysis revealed profiles characterized by prominent intrusions, avoidance, and hyperarousal (threat-reactivity profile; n = 129), anhedonia and negative affect (dysphoric profile; n = 195), and high levels of all PTSD symptoms (high-symptom profile; n = 99). The threat-reactivity profile had the most combat exposure and the least comorbidity. The dysphoric profile had the highest polygenic risk for major depression, and more personal life stress and co-occurring major depression than the threat-reactivity profile. The high-symptom profile had the highest rates of concurrent mental disorders and persistence of PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic and trauma-related factors likely contribute to PTSD heterogeneity, which can be parsed into subtypes that differ in symptom expression, comorbidity, and course. Future studies should evaluate whether PTSD typology modifies treatment response and should clarify distinctions between the dysphoric profile and depressive disorders."

The pandemic has forced many universities to transition rapidly to delivering online education. However, little is known about the impact of this drastic change on students' school adaptation. This cross-sectional study used an online questionnaire, including assessments of impressions of online education, study engagement, mental health, and lifestyle habits. In total, 1,259 students were assessed. The characteristics of school adaptation were analyzed by a two-step cluster analysis. The proportion of mental health problems was compared among different groups based on a cluster analysis. A logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of cluster membership. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The two-step cluster analysis determined three clusters: school adaptation group, school maladaptation group, and school over-adaptation group. The last group significantly exhibited the most mental health problems. Membership of this group was significantly associated with being female (OR = 1.42; 95% CI 1.06-1.91), being older (OR = 1.21; 95% CI 1.01-1.44), those who considered online education to be less beneficial (OR = 2.17; 95% CI 1.64-2.88), shorter sleep time on weekdays (OR = 0.826; 95% CI 0.683-.998), longer sleep time on holidays (OR = 1.21; 95% CI 1.03-1.43), and worse restorative sleep (OR = 2.27; 95% CI 1.81-2.86). The results suggest that academic staff should understand distinctive features of school adaptation owing to the rapid transition of the educational system and should develop support systems to improve students' mental health. They should consider ways to incorporate online classes with their lectures to improve students' perceived benefits of online education. Additionally, educational guidance on lifestyle, such as sleep hygiene, may be necessary."
Solis 2021,The 9-year clinical course of depressive and anxiety disorders: New NESDA findings.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.108,Solis EC and van Hemert AM and Carlier IVE and Wardenaar KJ and Schoevers RA and Beekman ATF and Penninx BWJH and Giltay EJ,2021,Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: In longitudinal research, switching between diagnoses should be considered when examining patients with depression and anxiety. We investigated course trajectories of affective disorders over a nine-year period, comparing a categorical approach using diagnoses to a dimensional approach using symptom severity. METHOD: Patients with a current depressive and/or anxiety disorder at baseline (N = 1701) were selected from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). Using psychiatric diagnoses, we described 'consistently recovered,' 'intermittently recovered,' 'intermittently recurrent', and 'consistently chronic' at two-, four-, six-, and nine-year follow-up. Additionally, latent class growth analysis (LCGA) using depressive, anxiety, fear, and worry symptom severity scores was used to identify distinct classes. RESULTS: Considering the categorical approach, 8.5% were chronic, 32.9% were intermittently recurrent, 37.6% were intermittently recovered, and 21.0% remained consistently recovered from any affective disorder at nine-year follow-up. In the dimensional approach, 66.6% were chronic, 25.9% showed partial recovery, and 7.6% had recovered. LIMITATIONS: 30.6% of patients were lost to follow-up. Diagnoses were rated by the interviewer and questionnaires were completed by the participant. CONCLUSIONS: Using diagnoses alone as discrete categories to describe clinical course fails to fully capture the persistence of affective symptoms that were observed when using a dimensional approach. The enduring, fluctuating presence of subthreshold affective symptoms likely predisposes patients to frequent relapse. The commonness of subthreshold symptoms and their adverse impact on long-term prognoses deserve continuous clinical attention in mental health care as well further research."
Stapp 2021,Mood and anxiety profiles differentially associate with physical conditions in US adolescents.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.11.056,Stapp EK and Paksarian D and He JP and Glaus J and Conway KP and Merikangas KR,2021,Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Mood and anxiety are widely associated with physical conditions, but research and treatment are complicated by their overlap, clinical heterogeneity, and manifestation on a spectrum rather than as discrete disorders. In contrast to previous work relying on threshold-level disorders, we examined the association between empirically-derived profiles of mood and anxiety syndromes with physical conditions in a nationally-representative sample of US adolescents. METHODS: Participants were 2,911 adolescents (aged 13-18) from the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement who provided information on physical conditions and reported at least one lifetime mood-anxiety 'syndrome' based on direct interviews with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Version 3.0. Mood-anxiety syndromes reflected 3-level ratings from subthreshold to severe distress/impairment, and subtyped mood episodes. Stepwise latent profile analysis identified mood-anxiety profiles and tested associations with physical conditions. RESULTS: Three mood-anxiety profiles were identified: ""Mood-GAD"" (25.6%)-non-atypical depression, mania, generalized anxiety; ""Atypical-Panic"" (11.3%)-atypical depression, panic; and ""Reference"" (63.1%)-lower mood and anxiety except specific phobia. Headaches were more prevalent in Mood-GAD and Atypical-Panic than Reference (47.9%, 50.1%, and 37.7%, respectively; p=0.011). Heart problems were more common in Mood-GAD than Atypical-Panic (7.4% v 2.2%, p=0.004) and Reference, with back/neck pain more prevalent in Mood-GAD than Reference (22.5% v 15.3%, p=0.016). LIMITATIONS: Broad categories of physical conditions without information on specific diagnoses; replication regarding specificity is recommended. CONCLUSIONS: Heart problems and pain-related conditions were differentially associated with specific mood-anxiety profiles. Subtyping depression and anxiety-inclusive of subthreshold syndromes-and their patterns of clustering may facilitate etiologic and intervention work in multimorbidity."
Djelantik 2021,"Prolonged grief disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression following traffic accidents among bereaved Balinese family members: Prevalence, latent classes and cultural correlates.",http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.05.085,Djelantik AAAMJ and Aryani P and Boelen PA and Lesmana CBJ and Kleber RJ,2021,Journal of affective disorders,"INTRODUCTION: Qualitative studies have described the rather unique styles of Balinese people to adjust to adversity. No quantitative research assessing psychopathology among bereaved individuals has been performed yet. This study estimated the prevalence of prolonged grief disorder (PGD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression among bereaved individuals after traffic deaths in Bali and the relations between subgroups sharing the same symptoms and cultural, socio-demographic characteristics and posttraumatic growth (PTG). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 301 participants participated in questionnaire-interviews assessing PGD, PTSD, depression, PTG and cultural and socio-demographic characteristics. On average, the time since loss was 16 months. The purpose of the rituals was examined by a thematic qualitative analysis. We performed latent class analyses and subsequently calculated the odds ratios between membership of classes and characteristics with a multivariate 3step analysis. RESULTS: Prevalence rates of PGD (0%), PTSD (1%) and moderate depression (2%) were low. Most participants followed the bereavement rituals characteristic for Balinese culture. The purpose of these rituals was mainly the expression of caring for the deceased. We found a large resilient class (76%) and two smaller classes, one characterized by elevated PGD symptoms (11%) and one by elevated PTSD symptoms (13%). Loss of close kin was associated with membership of the PTSD class. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence rates of PGD, PTSD and depression in the Balinese community were remarkably low. Participants appeared to be quite homogeneous in following religious and cultural habits. Aspects of the Balinese culture might protect bereaved individuals for developing mental health issues and could be used for an informed refinement of bereavement rituals in other cultures."
Jakobson 2021,Alexithymia and Sensory Processing Sensitivity: Areas of Overlap and Links to Sensory Processing Styles.,http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.583786,Jakobson LS and Rigby SN,2021,Frontiers in psychology,"Alexithymia is a dimensional trait characterized by difficulties identifying and describing feelings and an externally oriented thinking (EOT) style. Here, we explored interrelationships between alexithymia and measures assessing how individuals process and regulate their responses to environmental and body-based cues. Young adults (N = 201) completed self-report questionnaires assessing alexithymia, sensory processing sensitivity (SPS), interoceptive accuracy (IA), sensory processing styles, and current levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Whereas EOT was related to low orienting sensitivity, problems with emotional appraisal (difficulties identifying feelings/difficulties describing feelings) were related to heightened sensory sensitivity. In addition, features of SPS improved the prediction of alexithymia above and beyond that accounted for by IA. We suggest that EOT is linked to problems maintaining a representation of one's emotions in working memory and that low IA and problems with emotional appraisal are linked to atypicalities in sensory processing that may impact embodiment. A latent profile analysis revealed five classes of individuals distinguished by the relative strength of different alexithymic traits and by differences in IA and sensory processing styles. The classes identified included two lexithymic, one modal, and two alexithymic groups, showing different susceptibilities to SPS. Overall, our findings lend support to the view that alexithymia is associated with atypicalities in both bottom-up and top-down processes that impact emotion processing and regulation. They also raise the possibility that individuals with different alexithymia subtypes may differ with regard to a range of factors, including not only SPS but also early life experiences, mental health outcomes, and susceptibility to various personality disorders."
Wang 2021,The association of different parenting styles among depressed parents and their offspring's depression and anxiety: a cross-sectional study.,http://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03512-8,Wang Y and Shi H and Wang Y and Zhang X and Wang J and Sun Y and Wang J and Sun J and Cao F,2021,BMC psychiatry,"BACKGROUND: Parenting styles play a critical role in children's development, especially for those in families with a depressed parent. To date, no study has explored whether youth perceptions of parenting style are heterogeneous in families with a depressed parent or whether heterogeneous parenting styles are associated with children's internalizing symptoms. METHODS: Participants were children aged 8-16 years who had a parent with major depressive disorder; they were enrolled through their parents, who were outpatients at two hospitals in Ningxia. Parenting styles were measured using the Parental Bonding Instrument. Youth depression and anxiety were measured using the Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children and the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders, respectively. We applied latent profile analysis to identify the subtypes of parenting styles with similar patterns. Differences between subtypes in relation to demographic variables and parenting style scores were calculated using one-way ANOVAs, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and chi-squared tests. Bivariate logistic analyses were conducted to examine the associations between parental bonding subtypes and children's depression and anxiety. RESULTS: Four parenting styles were identified through latent profile analysis: care-autonomy, overprotection-indifference, indifference, and undifferentiated parenting. Youth with care-autonomy parents had a lower risk of depression (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.06-0.41) and anxiety (OR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.10-0.48), while indifference parenting increased children's risk of depression (OR: 5.29; 95% CI: 1.30-21.54) more than undifferentiated parenting. CONCLUSIONS: Children with a depressed parent had heterogeneous perceptions of parenting styles. Mothers' and fathers' parenting styles were largely congruent. Care-autonomy parenting (high care and high autonomy) may decrease children's risk of depression, whereas indifference parenting (low care and autonomy) may increase their risk of depression."
Kjærstad 2021,Neurocognitive heterogeneity in patients with bipolar disorder and their unaffected relatives: associations with emotional cognition.,http://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291719003738,Kjærstad HL and Eikeseth FF and Vinberg M and Kessing LV and Miskowiak K,2021,Psychological medicine,"BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that neurocognitive impairments in remitted patients with bipolar disorder (BD) are heterogeneous. Our study aims to replicate recent findings of neurocognitive subgroups, and further explore whether these are related to impairments in affective cognition, in a large sample of remitted patients recently diagnosed with BD and their unaffected relatives compared to healthy controls (HCs). METHODS: Hierarchal cluster analysis was conducted using neurocognitive data from remitted patients with BD (n = 158). Relatives of patients with BD (n = 52) were categorised into groups consistent with their affected relative's cluster assignment. The neurocognitive clusters of patients with BD and relatives, respectively, were compared with HCs (n = 110) in neurocognition and affective cognition (i.e. emotion processing and regulation). RESULTS: Three discrete neurocognitive clusters were identified in patients with BD: a globally impaired (23.4%), a selectively impaired (31.0%) and a cognitively intact cluster (45.6%). The neurocognitive subgroups differed in affective cognition, with patients categorised as globally impaired exhibited most impairments in facial expression recognition and emotion regulation in social scenarios. First-degree relatives of cognitively impaired patients displayed impaired facial expression recognition but no impairments in non-emotional cognition. CONCLUSIONS: In a clinical sample of remitted patients recently diagnosed with BD 54.4% had either global or selective cognitive impairment, replicating results of previous studies in patients with longer illness duration. The results suggest that patterns of neurocognition are associated with differential impairments in affective cognition. Aberrant affective cognition in relatives of patients categorised as neurocognitively impaired indicates an inherited risk for BD."
Moussavi 2021,Internalizing Symptom Profiles Among Youth in Foster Care: A Comparison Study.,http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.711626,Moussavi Y and Breivik K and Wergeland GJ and Haugland BSM and Larsen M and Lehmann S,2021,Frontiers in psychiatry,"Background: A high prevalence of anxiety and depression is found among youth in foster care. There is limited knowledge on the anxiety and depression symptom profiles of youth in foster care. We examined latent profiles of anxiety and depression symptoms across three unique youth samples and whether youth in foster care were more or less likely to belong to specific symptom profiles than their peers recruited from clinical or general youth populations. We also investigated if these profiles were predicted by sex and age. Methods: Self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed by Spence Children's Anxiety Scale and Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire. Data were pooled from three youth samples (N = 2,005; mean age = 13.9 years, range = 11-18 years) comprising youth in foster care (n = 245), a clinical youth sample (n = 107), and a general population youth sample (n = 1,653). Symptom profiles were identified using latent profile analyses. Multinominal logistic regression was used to predict the latent profile membership. Results: Three profiles that differed both in symptom level and shape were identified and labeled as low, medium, and high symptom profile. Compared to the general population youth sample, youth in foster care had a higher likelihood of belonging to the high symptom profile, but not the medium symptom profile. Youth from the clinical sample had an increased risk of belonging to the medium and high symptom profiles compared to the youth in foster care and general population youth samples. Across samples, girls yielded a higher likelihood of having a medium or high symptom profile. Increasing age was associated with a higher likelihood of being in the high symptom profile. Conclusion: Compared to their counterparts in the general population, youth in foster care are at risk of belonging to a class of youth with high symptom levels across subtypes of internalizing symptoms, indicating the importance of systematic and broad assessment of internalizing symptoms among these youth. Knowledge on the symptom profiles of anxiety subtypes and depression increases our understanding of the treatment needs of youth in foster care."

METHODS: The COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study is a longitudinal, nationally representative, online survey of UK adults. The current study analysed data from its first three waves of data collection: Wave 1 (March 2020, N = 2025), Wave 2 (April 2020, N = 1406) and Wave 3 (July 2020, N = 1166). Anxiety-depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (a composite measure of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7) and COVID-19-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with the International Trauma Questionnaire. Changes in mental health outcomes were modelled across the three waves. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify subgroups of individuals with different trajectories of change in anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD. Latent class membership was regressed on baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Overall prevalence of anxiety-depression remained stable, while COVID-19 PTSD reduced between Waves 2 and 3. Heterogeneity in mental health response was found, and hypothesised classes reflecting (i) stability, (ii) improvement and (iii) deterioration in mental health were identified. Psychological factors were most likely to differentiate the improving, deteriorating and high-stable classes from the low-stable mental health trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: A low-stable profile characterised by little-to-no psychological distress ('resilient' class) was the most common trajectory for both anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD. Monitoring these trajectories is necessary moving forward, in particular for the ~30% of individuals with increasing anxiety-depression levels."

METHODS: We collected personality traits from 100 drug-free patients with major depressive disorders (MDD) and 100 healthy controls based on the Five-Factor Model (FFM) such as Neuroticism (N) and Extraversion (E), and also obtained 63 plasma metabolites profiles by LCMS-based metabolome analysis. RESULTS: Partitional clustering analysis using the NEO-FFI data classified all subjects into three major clusters. Eighty-six subjects belonging to Cluster 1 (C1: less personality-biased group) constituted half of MDD patients and half of healthy controls. C2 constituted 50 subjects mainly MDD patients (N (high) + E (low)), and C3 constituted 64 subjects mainly healthy subjects (N (low) + E (high)). Using metabolome information, the machine learning model was optimized to discriminate MDD patients from healthy controls among all subjects and C1, respectively. The performance of the model for all subjects was moderate (AUC = 0. 715), while the performance was extremely improved when limited to C1 (AUC = 0. 907). Tryptophan-pathway plasma metabolites including tryptophan, serotonin and kynurenine were significantly lower in MDD patients especially among C1. We also validated metabolomic findings using a social-defeat mice model of stress-induced depression. LIMITATIONS: A case-control study design and sample size is not large. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that personality classification enhances blood biomarker analysis for MDD patients and further translational investigations should be conducted to clarify the biological relationship between personality traits, stress and depression."

Descriptive statistics explored somatic symptom endorsement in the entire sample. A latent class analyses was conducted on participants with a posttraumatic stress checklist (PCL) score ≥29 (n = 2433), with class differentiated by somatic symptom endorsement.Multinomial logistic regression explored correlates of latent class. Somatic disorder was more prevalent in probable-PTSD (59.6%) and subsyndromal-PTSD (26.5%) than no-PTSD (5.0%) groups, supporting an intersection of pathophysiological processes between somatic and PTSD symptoms. A 3-class solution of Syndromal (26.7%),Psychological (17.7%), and Somatic (55.5%) classes provided the optimal representation of latent somatic symptom typologies in probable PTSD and subsyndromal PTSD. Differences between classes on key characteristics supported potentially meaningful class distinctions. Class was not predicted by number of deployments nor whether a member had ever deployed. However, class was predicted by life-time trauma, indicating that the PTSD somatic symptom relationship is not confined to combat related PTSD or the effect of toxic exposures on deployment, but that pre-existing pathophysiology related to life-time trauma may drive the relationship.The high degree of coincidence between PTSD and somatic symptoms and the high prevalence of somatic distress in the Syndromal and Somatic classes support somatic symptoms are a ubiquitous aspect of the clinical presentation and should be considered a central characteristic of PTSD and therefore included in the diagnostic criteria, as suggested by the original formulations of PTSD."
Ahrenholtz 2021,Unique neurocircuitry activation profiles during fear conditioning and extinction among women with posttraumatic stress disorder.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.07.007,Ahrenholtz R and Hiser J and Ross MC and Privratsky A and Sartin-Tarm A and James GA and Cisler JM,2021,Journal of psychiatric research,"BACKGROUND: Neurocircuitry models of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) suggest specific alterations in brain structures linked with fear conditioning and extinction. Most models assume a unitary pattern of neurocircuitry dysfunction in PTSD and little attention has focused on defining unique profiles of neurocircuitry engagement (i.e., biotypes), despite known clinical heterogeneity in PTSD. Here, we aim to address this gap using a data-driven approach to characterize unique neurocircuitry profiles among women with PTSD. METHODS: Seventy-six women with PTSD related to assaultive violence exposure competed a task during fMRI that alternated between fear conditioning, where a geometric shape predicted the occurrence of an electric shock, and fear extinction, where the geometric shape no longer predicted electric shock. A multivariate clustering analysis was applied to neurocircuitry patterns constrained within an a priori mask of structures linked with emotion processing. Resulting biotypes were compared on clinical measures of neurocognition, trauma exposure, general mental health symptoms, and PTSD symptoms and on psychophysiological responding during the task. RESULTS: The clustering analysis identified three biotypes (BT), differentiated by patterns of engagement within salience, default mode, and visual processing networks. BT1 was characterized by higher working memory, fewer general mental health symptoms, and low childhood sexual abuse, and lower PTSD symptom severity. BT2 was characterized by lower verbal IQ but better extinction learning as defined by psychophysiology and threat expectancy. BT3 was characterized by low childhood sexual abuse, anxious arousal, and re-experiencing symptoms. CONCLUSION: This data demonstrates unique profiles of neurocircuitry engagement in PTSD, each associated with different clinical characteristics, and suggests further research defining distinct biotypes of PTSD.

We were interested in also assessing factors associated with the pain trajectory classes. METHODS: A total 747 participants completed measures of pain, depression, suicide ideation and behaviors, insomnia, substance use, and PTSD. Follow-up assessments were completed at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-baseline. Growth mixture modeling was conducted, and pain trajectories were modeled from baseline to month 12. RESULTS: Three classes were identified: mild pain intensity that increased over time to severe pain intensity (Increasing-Severe; n = 9), low pain intensity that decreased over time (Mild-Decreasing; n = 172), and moderate pain intensity that remained relatively stable over time (Moderate-Stable; n = 566). The Moderate-Stable trajectory had more severe PTSD symptoms, more frequent depression symptoms, and more severe insomnia. The odds of endorsing suicide ideation at month 12 were significantly higher in the Moderate-Stable trajectory compared to the Mild-Decreasing trajectory. CONCLUSIONS: This was the first study to assess classes of pain intensity trajectories among individuals who were treatment naïve for mental health issues. The findings suggest that a moderate stable trajectory of pain intensity over the course of 12 months is common and associated with a more severe clinical profile, including suicide ideation. This study underscores the importance of addressing pain intensity among individuals seeking mental health treatment, particularly for those with pain intensity that is moderate and stable over time."
Christian 2021,Latent profile analysis of impulsivity and perfectionism dimensions and associations with psychiatric symptoms.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.01.076,Christian C and Bridges-Curry Z and Hunt RA and Ortiz AML and Drake JE and Levinson CA,2021,Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Impulsivity and perfectionism are transdiagnostic personality factors that have been studied extensively and shown to relate to externalizing and internalizing pathology respectively. Typically, these personality factors are antithesized, with impulsivity characterized by lack of control and perfectionism characterized by rigid overcontrol. METHODS: The current study (N = 1,353 undergraduate students) used latent profile analysis to identify subgroups based on impulsivity and perfectionism dimensions and tested the relations of these subgroups with the symptomatology of ten prevalent types of psychopathology (depression, worry, social anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder inattentive subtype, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder impulsive-hyperactive subtype, alcohol use, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, restrictive eating pathology, and binge eating pathology). RESULTS: The latent profile analysis identified four meaningful subgroups: high perfectionism, high impulsivity, combined impulsivity and perfectionism, and low impulsivity and perfectionism. The combined group was the most prevalent, comprising almost half of the sample. Further, the perfectionism group had the highest scores for obsessive-compulsive disorder, worry, and restrictive eating pathology, the impulsivity group had the highest scores for alcohol use disorder, and the combined group had the highest or second-highest scores across all types of psychopathology. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the undergraduate sample, self-report, cross-sectional study design, and high bivariate residuals. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest impulsivity and perfectionism can co-occur. Further, the co-occurrence of these personality traits may heighten risk for psychopathology and help explain comorbidity across internalizing and externalizing disorders. Future research should continue to investigate the presentation, prevalence, and treatment for individuals high in both perfectionism and impulsivity."

The aim of the present study was to analyze cognitive variability in a sample of OABD. METHODS: A total of 138 OABD patients and 73 healthy controls were included in this study. A comprehensive neuropsychological assessment was administered. We performed a k-means cluster analysis method based on the neurocognitive performance to detect heterogeneous subgroups. Demographic, clinical, cognitive and functional variables were compared. Finally, univariate logistic regressions were conducted to detect variables associated with the severity of the cognitive impairment. RESULTS: We identified three distinct clusters based on the severity of cognitive impairment: (1) a preserved group (n = 58; 42%) with similar cognitive performance to HC, (2) a group showing mild cognitive deficits in all cognitive domains (n = 64; 46%) and, finally, (3) a group exhibiting severe cognitive impairment (n = 16; 12%). Older age, late onset, higher number of psychiatric admissions and lower psychosocial functioning were associated with the greatest cognitive impairment. Lower age, more years of education and higher estimated IQ were associated with a preserve cognitive functioning. LIMITATIONS: The small sample size of the severely impaired group. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive heterogeneity remains at late-life bipolar disorder. Demographic and specific illness factors are related to cognitive dysfunction. Detecting distinct cognitive subgroups may have significant clinical implications for tailoring specific intervention strategies adapted to the level of the impairment and also to prevent cognitive decline."

The present study examined if IGD is best conceptualized as categorical (present/absent), or dimensional (severity ranging from low to high), or both (i.e., hybrid of categorical/dimensional). METHODS: Ratings of the nine DSM-5 IGD symptoms, as presented in the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale 9-Short Form (Pontes & Griffiths, Comput Hum Behav 45:137-143, 2015), from 738 gamers, aged 17 to 72 years, were collected. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), latent class analysis (LCA), and factor mixture modelling analysis (FMMA) procedures were applied to determine the optimum IGD model. RESULTS: Although the findings showed most support for a FFMA model with two classes and one factor, there was also good statistical and substantive support for the one-factor CFA model, and the LCA model with three classes. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that while the optimum structure of IGD is most likely to be a hybrid model (i.e., concurrently categorical and dimensional), a uni-dimensional model and/or a three-class categorical model are also plausible."

It requires a non-discontinued pharmacological treatment to prevent mood recurrences but nonadherence to medication is frequent. To this date, medication adherence in BD has been mostly evaluated in cross-sectional studies and often considered as a stable trait. We aimed to study medication adherence using a prospective person-oriented approach. METHODS: 1627 BD patients were followed on a 2 years period and assessed every 6 months. Medication adherence was evaluated at each visit with the Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS). A latent class mixed model (LCMM) was used to identify trajectory classes of adherence over time. Regression analyses and linear mixed model were used to search for predictors and covariables of the trajectories. RESULTS: Three distinct and robust trajectories of medication adherence have been identified: one that starts poorly and keeps deteriorating (4.8%), one that starts poorly but improves (9%) and one that starts well and keeps improving (86.2%). A good tolerance to psychotropic medications, low depressive symptoms, the absence of comorbid eating disorders and anticonvulsant medication were associated to a better prognosis of adherence. Along the follow-up, the lower were the depressive symptoms, the better was the medication adherence (p < .001) LIMITATIONS: The use of a single measure of medication adherence although it is a validated instrument and a possible positive selection bias that might limit the generalization of our findings. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that medication adherence in BD patients is a heterogeneous and potentially variable phenomenon."

Few studies have examined user profiles using cannabis use motives and expectations. The association between user profiles and psychosocial functioning among only regular users remains unexplored. This exploration is important to improve public education efforts and design tailor treatment approaches. Methods: Regular cannabis users (at least weekly; n = 329) completed an online survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey measured levels of cannabis use, other substance use, motives and expectations of cannabis use, symptoms of psychosis, depression, anxiety and stress, and reckless behavior such as getting high before work or driving under the influence of cannabis. Latent class analysis was performed using motives and expectations to identify data driven patterns of regular cannabis use. Classes were then used to investigate mental health and behavioral correlates of differences in motives and expectations. Results: A 2-class solution provided the best fit to the data; Class 1: Low Motives and Expectancies (n = 158) characterized by lower endorsement across all motivation and expectation variables, and Class 2: High Motives and Expectancies (n = 171) characterized by endorsing multiple motivations, and higher positive and negative expectations of cannabis use. Classes differed in a range of cannabis use variables; e.g., greater proportion of peer use in Class 2. The High Motives and Expectancies users reported higher symptoms of psychosis (positive and negative symptoms), depression, anxiety, and stress. A higher proportion met the criteria for a cannabis use disorder compared with Low Motives and Expectancies users. High Motives and Expectancies users reported higher mean problems with nicotine dependence and illicit drug use other than cannabis and were more likely to get high before work and drive under the influence of cannabis. Conclusions: There is heterogeneity among young regular cannabis users in their motivations and expectancies of use and associated psychosocial functioning. Understanding motives and expectancies can help segregate which users are at higher risk of worse functioning. These findings are timely when designing targeted assessment and treatment strategies, particularly as cannabis is further decriminalized and accessibility increases."
Edwards 2021,"Associations Between Mental Health, Interoception, Psychological Flexibility, and Self-as-Context, as Predictors for Alexithymia: A Deep Artificial Neural Network Approach.",http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.637802,Edwards DJ and Lowe R,2021,Frontiers in psychology,"Background: Alexithymia is a personality trait which is characterized by an inability to identify and describe conscious emotions of oneself and others. Aim: The present study aimed to determine whether various measures of mental health, interoception, psychological flexibility, and self-as-context, predicted through linear associations alexithymia as an outcome. This also included relevant mediators and non-linear predictors identified for particular sub-groups of participants through cluster analyses of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) output. Methodology: Two hundred and thirty participants completed an online survey which included the following questionnaires: Toronto alexithymia scale; Acceptance and Action Questionnaire 2 (AQQII); Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS-SF), Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 21 (DAS21); Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA); and the Self-as-Context (SAC) scale. A stepwise backwards linear regression and mediation analysis were performed, as well as a cluster analysis of the non-linear ANN upper hidden layer output. Results: Higher levels of alexithymia were associated with increased psychological inflexibility, lower positive affect scores, and lower interoception for the subscales of ""not distracting"" and ""attention regulation."" SAC mediated the relation between emotional regulation and total alexithymia. The ANNs accounted for more of the variance than the linear regressions, and were able to identify complex and varied patterns within the participant subgroupings. Conclusion: The findings were discussed within the context of developing a SAC processed-based therapeutic model for alexithymia, where it is suggested that alexithymia is a complex and multi-faceted condition, which requires a similarly complex, and process-based approach to accurately diagnose and treat this condition."
Stavropoulos 2021b,Internet gaming disorder behaviours: a preliminary exploration of individualism and collectivism profiles.,http://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03245-8,Stavropoulos V and Frost TMJ and Brown T and Gill P and Footitt TA and Kannis-Dymand L,2021,BMC psychiatry,"BACKGROUND: Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) behaviours involve excessive use of Internet games to the extent that one's everyday life is compromised. It has been suggested that IGD symptoms are dependent on whether one is more individualistic or collectivistic. However, the range of potential individualism-collectivismeffects on IGD presentations remains largely unknown. The current study aims to further understanding of the role of individualistic and collectivistic tendencies in IGD, allowing us to develop more gamer centredIGD prevention and intervention strategies. METHODS: One thousand and thirty-twocommunity participants withinternet gaming experience were measured online for IGD symptom's severity using the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale - Short Form (IGDS9-SF) andindividualism-collectivism behavioursvia the Individualism & Collectivism Scale (ICS). Latent Class Analysis (LCA) and T-Tests were performed in relation to their responses. RESULTS: Upon inspection of the LCA output, two profiles of internet gamers were identified. These includedthe Collectivism Aversivegamers (CA; 11%) and the Collectivism Neutral gamers (CN; 89%). The CA gamers displayed significantly higher IGD behaviours overall, and, were higher inpreoccupation, withdrawal symptoms, tolerance, relapse, deception, escapism/mood modification, and functional impairment compared to CN gamers. There were no differences between CA and CN gamers in loss of interest and conflicts with others. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that one's individualism-collectivism orientation can influence the presentation of IGD. Specifically, those who are less collectivistic or are less influenced by social groups willdisplay greater IGD symptoms and present a profile that requires a different intervention from gamers who are more collectivistic. Researchers and clinicians should emphasize the value of belonging in a collective and experiencing equality with others in relation to mental health and gaming patterns."
Oh 2021,Problematic internet use in children according to maternal depression trajectories: A population-based cohort study with 9-year follow-up.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.07.025,Oh Y and Kim H and Joung YS,2021,Journal of psychiatric research,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated the association between maternal depression trajectories from pregnancy until 2 years postpartum, and problematic internet use in children at nine years of age. METHODS: A total of 1132 mother-child pairs from the Panel Korea Study for Children were used. Maternal depression was assessed repeatedly using the Kessler scale (K-scale) (during pregnancy, and at 6, 12, and 24 months of age). Problematic internet use was assessed in children 9 years old using the K-scale. The children's behavioral problems were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist at nine years old. Latent profile analysis was used to identify the group trajectories of maternal depression. We compared the severity of problematic internet use of the children according to the maternal depression trajectories. We also identified behavioral problems in children with problematic internet use in each maternal depression trajectory. RESULTS: Trajectory analysis identified three group trajectories of maternal depression: no symptoms (n = 478), mild symptoms (n = 534), and moderate symptoms (n = 120). The mild and moderate maternal depression trajectory groups were more associated with high-risk internet use in 9-year-old children compared to the non-depressed group. In children with high-risk internet use, more severe behavioral problems were reported when their mothers had depression. CONCLUSION: Maternal depression up to two years after childbirth affected problematic internet use in middle childhood."
Chan 2021,The 12-month prevalence of psychotic experiences and their association with clinical outcomes in Hong Kong: an epidemiological and a 2-year follow up studies.,http://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720001452,Chan SKW and Lee KKW and Chan VHY and Pang HH and Wong CSM and Hui CLM and Chang WC and Lee EHM and Chan WC and Cheung EFC and Chiu HFK and Chiang TP and Lam M and Lau JTF and Ng RMK and Hung SF and Lam LCW and Chen EYH,2021,Psychological medicine,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between the subtypes of psychotic experiences (PEs) and common mental health symptoms remains unclear. The current study aims to establish the 12-month prevalence of PEs in a representative sample of community-dwelling Chinese population in Hong Kong and explore the relationship of types of PEs and common mental health symptoms. METHOD: This is a population-based two-phase household survey of Chinese population in Hong Kong aged 16-75 (N = 5719) conducted between 2010 and 2013 and a 2-year follow-up study of PEs positive subjects (N = 152). PEs were measured with Psychosis Screening Questionnaire (PSQ) and subjects who endorsed any item on the PSQ without a clinical diagnosis of psychotic disorder were considered as PE-positive. Types of PEs were characterized using a number of PEs (single v. multiple) and latent class analysis. All PE-positive subjects were assessed with common mental health symptoms and suicidal ideations at baseline and 2-year follow-up. PE status was also assessed at 2-year follow-up. RESULTS: The 12-month prevalence of PEs in Hong Kong was 2.7% with 21.1% had multiple PEs. Three latent classes of PEs were identified: hallucination, paranoia and mixed. Multiple PEs and hallucination latent class of PEs were associated with higher levels of common mental health symptoms. PE persistent rate at 2-year follow-up was 15.1%. Multiple PEs was associated with poorer mental health at 2-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlighted the transient and heterogeneous nature of PEs, and that multiple PEs and hallucination subtype of PEs may be specific indices of poorer common mental health."
Gao 2021a,Different profiles with multiple risk factors of nonsuicidal self-injury and their transitions during adolescence: A person-centered analysis.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.004,Gao Q and Guo J and Wu H and Huang J and Wu N and You J,2021,Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a serious public health concern among adolescents. However, adolescents with different combinations of NSSI risk factors may constitute different subgroups that vary in subsequent risks of NSSI engagement, and the membership in these subgroups may change during early adolescence. Gender differences related to risk profiles and transition patterns may also exist. This study thus aimed to address these three questions. METHODS: A total of 2,942 participants ranging from 12 to 17 years old (55.2% females; M(age) = 14.60, SD = 1.21) completed a series of questionnaires about NSSI and its risk factors on three occasions, every six months. Latent profile and latent transition analyses were used to examine NSSI risk profiles (subgroups), their transition patterns, and gender differences. RESULTS: Three distinct risk profiles were identified: Low-risk profile, Medium-risk profile, and High-risk profile. The profile membership was fairly stable over one year, and the shift across profiles represented a ""resilient"" pattern. Regarding gender differences, boys were less likely to be in either the Medium- or the High-risk groups, but more likely to transition from the Medium- to the Low-risk group, relative to girls. LIMITATIONS: This study relied upon self-report measures. Additional research is needed to investigate the generalizability of the results to other populations, and to examine more predictors of class membership and transitions. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the importance of considering subgroup differences in understanding NSSI risks. Differentiated interventions with multi-pronged approaches tailoring to different risk classes and gender groups may therefore prove more efficient and effective."
Liu 2021b,"The association of phasic irritability (aggressive outbursts) and tonic irritability (irritable mood) to depression occurrences, symptoms, and subtypes.",http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.06.012,Liu Q and Cole DA,2021,Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Research among adults has rarely differentiated between tonic irritability (i.e., irritable mood) and phasic irritability (i.e., aggressive outbursts) with respect to multiple dimensions of depression. The current study explored both tonic and phasic irritability in relation to depression severity, depression chronicity, age of depression onset, individual depressive symptom, and depression subtypes. METHODS: The study included participants (N = 5692) from the National Comorbidity Survey - Replication (NCS-R) part two. The NCS-R used lay-administered, fully standardized diagnostic interviews. The current study implemented linear models, generalized linear models, Cox proportional hazard model, and latent class regression. RESULTS: Both types of irritability were significantly associated with greater risk for MDD diagnosis, as well as risk for having at least one depressive symptom, early MDE onset, and MDE chronicity. Both phasic and tonic irritability were associated with greater odds of specific depressive symptoms and were differentially related to distinct depressive symptom constellations. Phasic irritability related only to severe depression. Lastly, both phasic and tonic irritability was associated with suicidal ideation, but only phasic irritability was associated with a suicide plan and attempt, above and beyond depression subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Both phasic and tonic irritability differentially related to almost all aspects of depression in adults. Specifically, tonic irritability showed overall stronger associations with various depressive features, whereas phasic irritability marked higher depressive severity."

To enhance rigor and reproducibility in task-based research, it is advantageous to have stimulus sets that are publicly available and well characterized. Food Folio by Columbia Center for Eating Disorders is a publicly available set of 138 images of Western food items. The set was developed for the study of eating disorders, particularly for use in tasks that capture eating behavior characteristic of these illnesses. It contains foods that are typically eaten, as well as those typically avoided, by individuals with eating disorders. Each image has now been rated across 17 different attributes by a large general United States population sample via Amazon's Mechanical Turk (n = 1054). Ratings included subjective attributes (e.g., tastiness, healthiness, and favorable texture) as well as estimates of nutrient content (e.g., fat and carbohydrate). Each participant rated a subset of stimulus set food items (46 foods) on all 17 dimensions. Additional description of the image set is provided in terms of physical image information and accurate nutritional information. Correlations between subjective ratings were calculated and an exploratory factor analysis and exploratory cluster analysis completed. Outcomes of the factor analysis suggested foods may be described along three latent factors of healthiness, tastiness, and umami taste; the cluster analysis highlighted five distinct clusters of foods varying on these same dimensions. Descriptive outcomes indicated that the stimulus set includes a range of foods that vary along multiple dimensions and thus is likely to be useful in addressing various research questions surrounding eating behavior and cognition in healthy populations, as well as in those with eating disorders. The provision of comprehensive descriptive information allows for stimulus selection that is optimized for a given research question and promotes strong inference."
Morgan 2021,Rethinking the course of psychotic disorders: modelling long-term symptom trajectories.,http://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720004705,Morgan C and Dazzan P and Lappin J and Heslin M and Donoghue K and Fearon P and Jones PB and Murray RM and Doody GA and Reininghaus U,2021,Psychological medicine,"BACKGROUND: The clinical course of psychotic disorders is highly variable. Typically, researchers have captured different course types using broad pre-defined categories. However, whether these adequately capture symptom trajectories of psychotic disorders has not been fully assessed. Using data from AESOP-10, we sought to identify classes of individuals with specific symptom trajectories over a 10-year follow-up using a data-driven approach. METHOD: AESOP-10 is a follow-up, at 10 years, of 532 incident cases with a first episode of psychosis initially identified in south-east London and Nottingham, UK. Using extensive information on fluctuations in the presence of psychotic symptoms, we fitted growth mixture models to identify latent trajectory classes that accounted for heterogeneity in the patterns of change in psychotic symptoms over time. RESULTS: We had sufficient data on psychotic symptoms during the follow-up on 326 incident patients. A four-class quadratic growth mixture model identified four trajectories of psychotic symptoms: (1) remitting-improving (58.5%); (2) late decline (5.6%); (3) late improvement (5.4%); (4) persistent (30.6%). A persistent trajectory, compared with remitting-improving, was associated with gender (more men), black Caribbean ethnicity, low baseline education and high disadvantage, low premorbid IQ, a baseline diagnosis of non-affective psychosis and long DUP. Numbers were small, but there were indications that those with a late decline trajectory more closely resembled those with a persistent trajectory. CONCLUSION: Our current approach to categorising the course of psychotic disorders may misclassify patients. This may confound efforts to elucidate the predictors of long-term course and related biomarkers."
Rabelo-da-Ponte 2021,From phone use to speeding and driving under influence: Identifying clusters of driving risk behaviors as an opportunity for targeted interventions.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.11.025,Rabelo-da-Ponte FD and Scherer JN and Roglio V and Borges EN and Galland F and Sousa T and Passos IC and von Diemen L and Kessler F and Pechansky F,2021,Journal of psychiatric research,"Identifying the profile of risky behaviors among drivers is central to propose effective interventions. Due to the multidimensional and overlapping aspects of risky driving behaviors, cluster analysis can provide additional insights in order to identify specific subgroups of risk. This study aimed to identify clusters of driving risk behavior (DRB) among car drivers, and to verify intra-cluster differences concerning clinical and sociodemographic variables. We approached a total of 12,231 drivers and we included 6392 car drivers. A cluster algorithm was used to identify groups of car drivers in relation to the DRB: driving without a seat belt (SB), exceeding the speed limit (SPD), using a cell phone while driving (CELL), and driving after drinking alcohol (DUI). The algorithm classified drivers within five different DRB profiles. In cluster 1 (20.1%), subjects with a history of CELL. In cluster 2 (41.4%), drivers presented no DRB. In cluster 3 (9.3%), all drivers presented SPD. In cluster 4 (12.5%), drivers presented all DRB. In cluster 5 (16.6%), all drivers presented DUI. Clusters with DUI-related offenses (4 and 5) comprised more men (81.9 and 78.8%, respectively) than the overall sample (63.4%), with more binge drinking (50.9 and 45.7%) and drug use in the previous year (13.5 and 8.6%). Cluster 1 had a high years of education (14.4 ± 3.4) and the highest personal income (Md = 3000 IQR [2000-5000]). Cluster 2 had older drivers (46.6 ± 15), and fewer bingers (10.9%). Cluster 4 had the youngest drivers (34.4 ± 11.4) of all groups. Besides reinforcing previous literature data, our study identified five unprecedented clusters with different profiles of drivers regarding DRB. We identified an original and heterogeneous group of drivers with only CELL misuse, as well as other significant differences among clusters. Hence, our findings show that targeted interventions must be developed for each subgroup in order to effectively produce safe behavior in traffic."
Coid 2021b,Testing extra-linearity across a psychosis continuum.,http://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03498-3,Coid JW and Zhang Y and Zeng J and Li X and Lv Q and Tang W and Wang Q and Deng W and Guo W and Zhao L and Ma X and Meng Y and Li M and Wang H and Chen T and Yang M and Li T,2021,BMC psychiatry,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether psychotic experiences (PEs) gradually merge into states of clinical psychosis along a continuum which correspond to a dimensional classification or whether latent classes appear above a certain severity threshold which correspond better to diagnostic categories of psychosis. METHODS: Annual cross-sectional surveys, 2014-19, among Chinese undergraduates (N = 47,004) measured PEs, depression and etiological risk factors using standardized self-report instruments. We created a psychosis continuum with five levels and tested linear and extra-linear contrasts in associated etiological risk factors, before and after adjustment for depression. We carried out latent class analysis. RESULTS: Categorical expression of psychosis, including hallucinations and delusions, nuclear symptoms, and nuclear symptoms and depression were found at severe level 5. Etiological risk factors which impacted linearly across the continuum were more common for depression. Child maltreatment impacted extra-linearly on both psychosis and depression. Family history of psychosis impacted linearly on psychosis; male sex and urban birth impacted extra-linearly and were specific for psychosis. Four latent classes were found, but only at level 5. These corresponded to nuclear schizophrenia symptoms, nuclear schizophrenia and depressive symptoms, severe depression, and an unclassified category with moderate prevalence of PEs. CONCLUSION: Quantitative and qualitative changes in the underlying structure of psychosis were observed at the most severe level along a psychosis continuum, where four latent classes emerged. These corresponded to existing categorical classifications but require confirmation with clinical interview. PEs are non-specific and our findings suggest some are on a continuum with depression, whilst others are on a continuum with non-affective psychosis. Differing patterns of impact from etiological risk factors across the spectrum of psychopathology determine outcome at the most severe level of these continua."
Romero 2021,Impact of Users' Attitudes Toward Anonymous Internet Interventions for Cannabis vs. Alcohol Use: A Secondary Analysis of Data From Two Clinical Trials.,http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.730153,Romero D and Johansson M and Hermansson U and Lindner P,2021,Frontiers in psychiatry,"Background: Numerous trials have demonstrated the efficacy of internet interventions targeting alcohol or cannabis use, yet a substantial proportion of users do not benefit from the format, warranting further research to identify moderators of treatment effects. Users' initial attitudes toward treatment is a potential moderator, yet no previous study has investigated users' attitudes in the context of internet interventions for addictive disorders. Method: In this secondary analysis on two internet-based trials targeting harmful alcohol use (n = 1,169) and regular cannabis use (n = 303), respectively, we compared user groups' attitudes at the item level; explored within-group heterogeneity by submitting attitude scores to a k-means cluster analysis; and investigated whether latent subgroups in each user group moderated the treatment effects. Outcome models were run using generalized linear models with 10,000 bias-corrected bootstraps accounting for subject-level clustering. Results: While substance groups and latent subgroups converged in enjoying the anonymity provided by the format, their interest toward treatment differed. Outcome analyses revealed a significant and negative time by subgroup effect on grams of cannabis consumed and screening test score (CAST), favoring the subgroup with positive treatment attitudes. There were not any significant effects of subgroup on alcohol consumption. Despite initial treatment reluctance, participants in the neutral subgroup decreased their cannabis use (gram) significantly when receiving the intervention vs. control. Conclusions: This first, exploratory study revealed key differences between substance groups' attitudes, but more importantly that within-group heterogeneity appear to affect cannabis outcomes. Assessing attitudes could be key in patient-treatment matching, yet more research is needed."

The first year at college is a particularly vulnerable period for internet addiction. Students' psychological characteristics are likely to play an important role in internet addiction. Our study aimed to assess the relationship between impulsivity, social support, depression and internet addiction among male college freshmen. Materials and Methods: The current study utilized latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify at-risk profiles among 734 college freshmen (100% male) based on their Internet Addiction Test item ratings. We compared the levels of impulsivity, social support and depression among different profiles and investigated whether these variables could predict each latent internet addiction class. Results: LPA resulted in three distinct profiles: the low internet addiction group (42.10%), the moderate internet addiction group (35.70%) and the high internet addiction group (22.20%). Impulsivity and depression increased with internet addiction severity levels, whereas social support was inversely related to the severity of internet addiction. Male freshmen with high impulsivity, low social support and high depression were more likely to be included in the high internet addiction group. Conclusion: This study highlights that impulsivity, social support and depression may predict internet addiction in male college freshmen. Our findings have important practical implications for college educators and counselors in developing interventions for internet addiction."
Sforza 2021,Depressive and stress symptoms in insomnia patients predict group cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia long-term effectiveness: A data-driven analysis.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.04.021,Sforza M and Galbiati A and Zucconi M and Casoni F and Hensley M and Ferini-Strambi L and Castronovo V,2021,Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Insomnia Disorder is characterized by high degree of phenotypic heterogeneity, that might influence treatment response. METHODS: 123 of 294 insomnia patients initially recruited (66.7% females, age=40.59±11.89) were assessed before and after group Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), as well as at follow-up (7.8±1.6 years after the end-of-treatment). By use of latent class analysis (LCA) we identified insomnia subtypes according with baseline scores of insomnia severity and features, anxiety, depression, stress and sleepiness symptoms, circadian rhythm, and treatment effectiveness (Delta score of Insomnia Severity Index-ISI between baseline and end-of-treatment). RESULTS: By LCA we revealed three classes: ""PURE INSOMNIA"", ""INSOMNIA+ANXIETY+DEPRESSION+STRESS"", and ""INSOMNIA+ANXIETY"". The improvements in insomnia severity was maintained up to 10 years after the end-of-treatment, but with differences between classes (p<0.05). Class ""INSOMNIA+ANXIETY+DEPRESSION+STRESS"" showed at the end-of-treatment the largest percentage of responders (63.5% = Insomnia Severity Index decrease ≥8). However, at follow up the effect was less and 48.1% had a moderate or severe insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index >14). LIMITATIONS: The lack of a control group and the absence of a complete clinical assessment at the follow-up limit the interpretability of our results. CONCLUSIONS: Our data driven analysis suggest insomnia heterogeneity can be categorized into sub-classes by depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. In addition, insomnia patients with stress and depression symptoms maintained highest percentage of clinical depression at the end-of-treatment and insomnia at follow-up, in comparison with others classes. Stress and depression symptoms should be considered risk factors that play an important role in the long-term outcome of CBT-I."

In these stressful times, intimate relationships functioning could serve as a protective or a risk factor to the well-being of partners. Adult Croatian citizens engaged in intimate relationships (N = 727) reported their relationship characteristics and assessed symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress during the state lockdown in May 2020. Three relationship profiles based on variations in key relationship characteristics were identified using latent profile analysis. Profiles represented distinct relationship types described as affectionate, ambivalent, and antagonistic relationships. These relationship types differed in their levels of love and perception of humility, responsiveness, and behavior of the partner. Relationship type was associated with mental health symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic and state lockdown. Being in an affectionate relationship was associated with the lowest levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, while in an antagonistic relationship these are in the highest levels. Ambivalent relationships were characterized by moderate levels on all measured mental health indicators with no difference in anxiety compared with affectionate relationships. The results emphasized the link between relationship functioning and successful coping with mental health hazards such as the fear of disease or restrictive measures put in place to contain the COVID-19 pandemic."
Kim 2021,Latent Profile of Internet and Internet Game Usage Among South Korean Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.714301,Kim D and Lee J and Nam JK,2021,Frontiers in psychiatry,"Introduction: Globally, more people are spending time on the Internet and gaming since the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Consequently, concerns about developing behavioral addiction of adolescents have been raised. Such risk could be greater for adolescents in South Korea where the majority of adolescents have access to the Internet and own a smartphone. In fact, statistics indicate that Korean youths are spending significantly more time on the Internet and gaming during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous studies on the patterns of time spent on the Internet and Internet gaming show inconsistent results. The aim of this study is to investigate the latent profiles of the Internet and Internet game usage among adolescents in South Korea. Method: Data from a national survey on elementary and middle school students across South Korea were used. The sample consists of 3,149 respondents, and 2,984 responses were analyzed after removing missing responses. Latent profile analysis was performed to investigate the number of latent profiles for the Internet and Internet game usage time. To validate the profiles, differences in problematic gaming behavior, sex, and neuroticism were examined. Results: Seven profiles were found: Casual User, Moderate User, Smartphone User, Internet User, PC Internet Gamer, Heavy User, and Excessive User. Validation of the profiles indicated differences in problematic gaming behavior, sex, and neuroticism among selected profiles. Conclusion: This study presented different profiles of the Internet and Internet game usage among adolescents in South Korea. Profiles with higher game usage time scored higher in problematic game use compared to other profiles. Males were more likely to be in the profiles with high gaming time, and females were more likely to be in Internet and Smartphone User profiles. The results indicate that Internet and Internet gaming usage patterns could be classified by the type of device used and the content of the Internet."
Evans 2021,Modular Psychotherapy Outcomes for Youth With Different Latent Profiles of Irritability and Emotion Dysregulation.,http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.618455,Evans SC and Wei MA and Harmon SL and Weisz JR,2021,Frontiers in psychiatry,"Background: Severe irritability is a common, impairing problem among youth referred for mental health services, but evidence to guide care is limited. Treatment research can be advanced by adopting a transdiagnostic perspective, leveraging existing evidence-based treatment (EBT) techniques, and situating irritability within the context of emotion dysregulation. Accordingly, this study examined treatment outcomes for youth with different levels of irritability and dysregulation who received cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or behavioral parent training (BPT) in a modular EBT framework. Method: We analyzed data from a community-based implementation trial of a transdiagnostic youth psychotherapy. Two-hundred treatment-referred youths (7-15 years; 47% female; 33% White, 28% Black, 24% Latinx, 14% multiracial, 2% other) and their caregivers completed measures of clinical problems and emotion dysregulation at baseline, with repeated outcomes assessments over 18 months. First, latent profile analysis was applied to baseline irritability and emotion dysregulation data; then, latent growth curve models were used to examine outcome trajectories, controlling for covariates. Results: A two-class solution fit well, differentiating youth with high (n = 54) vs. low (n = 146) levels of dysregulation and irritability at baseline. Nearly all high-dysregulation youth received either BPT (n = 26) or CBT-Depression (n = 23). Across measures, both groups showed statistically and clinically significant improvements over time. High-dysregulation youth had greater baseline severity than low-dysregulation youth, but otherwise their longitudinal trajectories were mostly similar, with few between-group slope differences. There was virtually no evidence of differential effects for BPT vs. CBT on clinical outcomes. Conclusions: Youth with severe irritability and dysregulation, treated with a transdiagnostic, modular, EBT approach, showed significant within-person improvements over time. Their outcome trajectories did not differ according to whether they received BPT or CBT. Findings extend the literature on modular, transdiagnostic, and EBT approaches for irritability and dysregulation, suggesting comparable benefits associated with BPT and CBT when treatment selection is guided by comprehensive assessment.

The study participants were 1,201 students of Compulsory Secondary Education (M = 14.43, SD = 1.43), and 50.6% were girls. The TAMAI Test (multifactorial adaptation self-evaluation test) and the FRIDA questionnaire (Interpersonal Risk Factors for Drug Use in Adolescence) were used. A latent class analysis (LCA) revealed three different types of adaptation: maladjusted group, at-risk group, and adjusted group. The results showed the existence of significant differences between the different adaptation profiles based on interpersonal risk factors. The data obtained will help school and mental health plans to prevent misbehaving or risky behaviors."

SHS of each latent class were examined by race/ethnicity to inform risk factors relevant to subgroups of U.S. college population. METHODS: The participants (N = 42,779) were drawn from the Spring 2017 American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment II (ACHA-NCHA II) Reference Group. Latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted based on participants' reports of past-year psychiatric symptoms. The reported SHS were examined by the latent class of students and their race/ethnicity. RESULTS: LCA identified two latent classes: The Emotional Exhaustion (EE) class and the Multiple Psychiatric Symptoms (MPS) class. Within the EE class, Black students were at the greatest risk for exhibiting suicide intent and attempted suicide. Within the MPS class, Multiracial students showed the highest odds of self-harm and suicidal intent, and Black students showed the highest odds of attempted suicide, followed by Asians/Pacific Islanders. LIMITATIONS: The findings were based on a cross-sectional dataset that did not inform the temporal relations of psychiatric symptoms and SHS. CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing a person-centered latent class analysis, this study revealed that Black students were of the greatest concern for SHS among those who reported only common symptoms of emotional exhaustion. The findings highlight the importance of developing preventive and remedial models that address unique risk factors and mental health needs for various subgroups of U.S. college population."
Lowe 2021,Posttraumatic stress disorder symptom trajectories within the first year following emergency department admissions: pooled results from the International Consortium to predict PTSD.,http://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291719004008,Lowe SR and Ratanatharathorn A and Lai BS and van der Mei W and Barbano AC and Bryant RA and Delahanty DL and Matsuoka YJ and Olff M and Schnyder U and Laska E and Koenen KC and Shalev AY and Kessler RC,2021,Psychological medicine,"BACKGROUND: Research exploring the longitudinal course of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms has documented four modal trajectories (low, remitting, high, and delayed), with proportions varying across studies. Heterogeneity could be due to differences in trauma types and patient demographic characteristics. METHODS: This analysis pooled data from six longitudinal studies of adult survivors of civilian-related injuries admitted to general hospital emergency departments (EDs) in six countries (pooled N = 3083). Each study included at least three assessments of the clinician-administered PTSD scale in the first post-trauma year. Latent class growth analysis determined the proportion of participants exhibiting various PTSD symptom trajectories within and across the datasets. Multinomial logistic regression analyses examined demographic characteristics, type of event leading to the injury, and trauma history as predictors of trajectories differentiated by their initial severity and course. RESULTS: Five trajectories were found across the datasets: Low (64.5%), Remitting (16.9%), Moderate (6.7%), High (6.5%), and Delayed (5.5%). Female gender, non-white race, prior interpersonal trauma, and assaultive injuries were associated with increased risk for initial PTSD reactions. Female gender and assaultive injuries were associated with risk for membership in the Delayed (v. Low) trajectory, and lower education, prior interpersonal trauma, and assaultive injuries with risk for membership in the High (v. Remitting) trajectory. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that over 30% of civilian-related injury survivors admitted to EDs experience moderate-to-high levels of PTSD symptoms within the first post-trauma year, with those reporting assaultive violence at increased risk of both immediate and longer-term symptoms."
Yee 2021,Dynamics of data-driven microstates in bipolar disorder.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.07.021,Yee MA and Yocum AK and McInnis MG and Cochran AL,2021,Journal of psychiatric research,"Many of the existing models of mood in bipolar disorder can largely be divided into two camps, tracking mood as either a discrete or continuous variable. Both groups rely upon certain assumptions, with most considering only aggregate scores on clinical instruments. In this study, we propose a novel framework that combines elements from both discrete and continuous mood models, using a machine learning pipeline to detect subtle patterns across individuals. Latent factors are constructed from assessments at the item level, then clustered into groups referred to as microstates. Transitions between microstates are captured via a discrete-time Markov chain, allowing for characterization of mood's dynamic nature. Key findings include a factor mapping heavily onto irritability and aggression, as well as a hierarchical pattern of microstates within depression and mania. Validity of these results is confirmed by reproduction in an unseen data set from a separate subject cohort."

However, most studies focus on symptoms of psychiatric disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, depression), which are limited by heterogeneity and symptom overlap. We examined trajectories of cross-cutting posttraumatic symptom dimensions following traumatic injury and predictors of trajectory membership. METHODS: In this longitudinal study of 427 predominantly Hispanic/Latino traumatic injury survivors, posttraumatic psychopathology symptoms were assessed during hospitalization and approximately one and five months post-trauma. Using latent class growth analysis, we estimated trajectories of several posttraumatic symptom dimensions: re-experiencing, avoidance, anxious arousal, numbing, dysphoric arousal, loss, and threat. We then examined sociodemographic and trauma-related characteristics (measured during hospitalization) as predictors of trajectory membership for each dimension. RESULTS: Four trajectories (Resilient, Chronic, Delayed Onset, Recovery) emerged for all dimensions except loss and threat, which manifested three trajectories (Resilient, Chronic, Delayed Onset). Across dimensions, membership in the Chronic (vs. Resilient) trajectory was consistently predicted by unemployment (7 of 7 dimensions), followed by older age (3/7), female sex (3/7), and assaultive trauma (2/7). For several dimensions, unemployment also distinguished between participants who presented with similar symptom levels days after trauma, but then diverged over time. LIMITATIONS: Measures of posttraumatic symptom dimension constructs differed across assessments. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of distinct trajectories across transdiagnostic symptom dimensions after traumatic injury. Employment status emerged as the most important predictor of trajectory membership. Research is needed to better understand the etiologies and consequences of these posttraumatic symptom dimension trajectories."

We sought to investigate effects of timing of child abuse on conduct problem trajectories in a large UK birth cohort study. METHODS: We applied latent class growth analysis to identify conduct problem trajectories in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, using parent-rated conduct problems from ages 4-17 years (N = 10,648). Childhood-only and adolescence-only abuse, in addition to abuse in both developmental periods ('persistent' abuse), were assessed by retrospective self-report at age 22 years (N = 3172). RESULTS: We identified four developmental trajectories: early-onset persistent (4.8%), adolescence-onset (4.5%), childhood-limited (15.4%), and low (75.3%) conduct problems. Childhood-only abuse and 'persistent' abuse were associated with increased odds of being on the early-onset persistent and adolescence-onset conduct problem trajectories compared to the low conduct problems trajectory. Adolescence-only abuse was not predictive of trajectory membership. There were no associations between abuse and childhood-limited trajectory membership. CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset persistent and adolescence-onset conduct problems showed similar patterns of association with abuse exposure, challenging developmental theories that propose qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, differences in environmental risk factors between these trajectories. The results also highlight that childhood-only and 'persistent' abuse were more strongly linked to elevated conduct problem trajectories than adolescence-only abuse, and that 'persistent' abuse is particularly detrimental."

This study aimed to characterize the patterns of perceived stress in pregnant Chinese women during the COVID-19 pandemic, to examine the profile differences on anxiety and resilience, and to investigate whether the differences in these profiles on anxiety were mediated by resilience. Methods: From February 28, 2020 to April 26, 2020, a sample of 2,116 pregnant Chinese women who participated in online crisis interventions completed an online self-reporting questionnaire assessing their demographic characteristics, perceived stress, resilience, and anxiety. Results: Latent profile analysis (LPA) on two stress dimensions [perceived helplessness (HEL) and perceived self-efficacy (SEL)] indicated four perceived stress profiles: adaptive (33.7% of the sample), resistant (44.6%), insensitive (19.1%), and sensitive (2.6%). The women with both adaptive and insensitive profiles had the lowest levels of anxiety, whereas those with the resistant profile had the lowest levels of resilience. Multicategorical mediation analysis showed that resilience partially mediated the differences in the pregnant women's anxiety between the adaptive/insensitive and resistant profile. Conclusion: This study showed the heterogeneity in the perceived stress patterns of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic, revealing the internal mechanisms of pregnant women's anxiety using a person-centered approach, and provided initial evidence guiding the development of differentiated stress interventions to alleviate pregnant women's anxiety during the pandemic."
Junus 2022,Suicide risk profile and the social convoy: Population-level patterns of the young generation's help-seeking behavior and implications for suicide prevention.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.10.106,Junus A and Yip PSF,2022,Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Social support network offers a large potential in augmenting suicide prevention efforts tailored for the young generation (YG), but has so far been largely overlooked in population health studies. Key issues that remain scarcely understood include the composition of the YG's activated support network when they faced psychological distress, along with the prevalence and suicide risk profile associated with these patterns. METHODS: Using data from three consecutive population-representative surveys (2018-2020) on help-seeking behaviors of the YG living in Hong Kong, we first conducted latent class analysis to derive the YG's help-seeking patterns. Next, we conducted multinomial logistic regression to identify unique factors associated with each pattern and multiple logistic regressions for suicide risk indicators to examine risk levels associated with each pattern. RESULTS: Analyses revealed 4 underlying patterns of help-seeking behaviors among the study population. Each pattern was consistently associated with a distinct suicide risk profile based on constituents' level of distress and history of suicide risk behaviors. Severity of suicide risk increased as individuals increased the activation radius of their social convoy, and this increase was more pronounced when individuals extended the radius beyond their inner circle. Individuals whose activated inner circle consisted of family members in addition to just friends & partner had lower suicide risks. CONCLUSIONS: Social support networks hold much potential in augmenting suicide prevention efforts tailored for the general young population. Such efforts may be directed at empowering the inner circle of their convoy, given its predominance for the YG to seek help from."

TDT with consequent iron overload and inflammation is associated with increased severity of depressive symptoms in TDT children. AIM OF THE STUDY: To construct a pathway-phenotype which combines iron overload and neuro-immune biomarkers with depressive symptom subdomains in TDT children. METHODS: We measured iron status parameters (iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation percentage) and inflammatory (interleukin-1β and tumour necrosis factor-α) biomarkers in TDT (n=111) and healthy (n=53) children and analyzed the results using machine learning. RESULTS: Cluster analysis separated TDT children with depression from those without depression and revealed two depressive subgroups one with low self-esteem and another with increased social-irritability scores. Exploratory factor analysis validated four depressive symptom dimensions as reliable constructs, namely key depressive, physiosomatic, lowered self-esteem and social-irritability dimensions. Partial Least Squares showed that 73.0% of the variance in a latent vector extracted from those four clinical subdomains, immune-inflammatory and iron overload biomarkers was explained by exposure variables including the number of blood transfusions and hospitalizations and use of deferoxamine. The exposure data, iron and immune biomarkers, and symptom subdomains are reflective manifestations of a single latent trait, which shows internal consistency reliability and predictive relevance. CONCLUSIONS: The nomological network combining exposure, pathways and behavioral phenome manifestations provides an index of overall severity and disease risk and, therefore, constitutes a new drug target, indicating that iron overload and immune activation should be targeted to treat depression due to TDT."

Based on Schwartz's theory of human basic values, the current study combines variable-centered and person-centered approaches to examine the relationships between adolescents' values and mental health across two regions in China. The results generally showed that (1) both self-enhancement and conservation values were positively correlated with depression and loneliness, while both self-transcendence and openness to change values negatively correlated with depression and loneliness. The results also showed that (2) there were four value clusters (i.e., self-focus, other-focus, anxiety-free, undifferentiated), and, compared to adolescents in the self-focus and undifferentiated values cluster, all adolescents in the anxiety-free values cluster reported lower depression and loneliness, while all adolescents in the other-focus values cluster reported higher depression and loneliness. The differences between the two regional groups only emerged in depression. Specifically, adolescents in Shanghai have higher levels of depression than adolescents in Qingdao. This study provides some evidence for the new science of self-transcendence among adolescents and also sheds light on how we may improve the level of mental health during the COVID-19 era."
Bhullar 2021,Profiling Suicide Exposure Risk Factors for Psychological Distress: An Empirical Test of the Proposed Continuum of Survivorship Model.,http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.692363,Bhullar N and Sanford RL and Maple M,2021,Frontiers in psychiatry,"The Continuum of Survivorship proposes a way in which individuals may experience the suicide death of someone known to them along a continuum from being exposed to the death through to long-term bereavement. The present study provides a first empirical testing of the proposed model in an Australian community sample exposed to suicide. Using a Latent Profile Analysis, we tested the suicide exposure risk factors (time since death, frequency of pre-death contact, reported closeness, and perceived impact) to map to the Continuum of Survivorship model. Results revealed identification of five profiles, with four ranging from suicide exposed to suicide bereaved long-term broadly aligning with the proposed model, with one further profile being identified that represented a discordant profile of low closeness and high impact of suicide exposure. Our findings demonstrate that while the proposed model is useful to better understand the psychological distress related to exposure to suicide, it cannot be used as ""shorthand"" for identifying those who will be most distressed, nor those who may most likely need additional support following a suicide death. Implications and future research directions are discussed."

Data-driven subtyping of this clinically heterogeneous patient population and the associated underlying neural mechanisms are highly needed to identify who will benefit from psychotherapy. METHODS: In 53 comorbid PTSD/AUD patients, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was collected prior to undergoing individual psychotherapy. We used a data-driven approach to subgroup patients based on directed connectivity profiles. Connectivity subgroups were compared on clinical measures of PTSD severity and heavy alcohol use collected at pre- and post-treatment. RESULTS: We identified a subgroup of patients associated with improvement in PTSD symptoms from integrated-prolonged exposure therapy. This subgroup was characterized by lower insula to inferior parietal cortex (IPC) connectivity, higher pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) to posterior midcingulate cortex connectivity and a unique pgACC to IPC path. We did not observe any connectivity subgroup that uniquely benefited from integrated-coping skills or subgroups associated with change in alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Data-driven approaches to characterize PTSD/AUD subtypes have the potential to identify brain network profiles that are implicated in the benefit from psychological interventions - setting the stage for future research that targets these brain circuit communication patterns to boost treatment efficacy."
Mai 2021,What Type of Social Support Is Important for Student Resilience During COVID-19? A Latent Profile Analysis.,http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.646145,Mai Y and Wu YJ and Huang Y,2021,Frontiers in psychology,"In the face of the sudden outbreak of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), some students showed resilience in coping with difficulties while some did not. While different types of students showed different levels of resilience, are there significant characteristics among students with similar levels of resilience? In this study, 3,454 students (aged 15-25 years) were surveyed to understand students' perceived social support-coping modes while investigating the demographic characteristics and mental health status of subclasses of different modes. We found that (1) in the two subgroups of students with extremely low and low levels of perceived social support, the source of students' perceived social support did not have a clear orientation; in the two subgroups with moderate and high levels of perceived social support, the most perceived emotional support was from family and friends, while the least perceived support was companionship from teachers, classmates, and relatives, and problems related to the dependability of friends and communication with family. (2) The degree of social support perceived by students is directly proportional to the coping tendency, i.e., as the degree of perceived social support increases, the proportion of students adopting active coping strategies increases while that of students adopting negative coping strategies decreases; thus, we concluded that high levels of emotional support from family and friends can increase students' tendency of adopting positive strategies to cope with difficulties, while problems related to the dependability of friends and communication with family decrease students' tendency of adopting positive coping strategies. (3) Gender had a significant impact on the extremely low and low levels of perceived social support-negative coping tendencies; these subgroups accounted for 34.6% of the total students. Gender showed no significant influence on other subgroups, a school type had no impact on the distribution of the subgroups. (4) The higher the degree of perceived social support, the lower is the degree of students' general anxiety, and the lower is the degree of impact by the COVID-19 pandemic. The subdivision of student groups allows us to design more targeted support programmes for students with different psychological characteristics to help them alleviate stress during the COVID-19 epidemic."

However, research addressing all phenomena is scarce. Objective: The current study aims to explore differences between offender patients with SSD and CM and those with SSD and no CM in terms of their offending, psychopathology at different points in time and treatment outcome. Method: In the present explorative study, latent class analysis was used to analyze differences between 197 offender patients with SSD and CM and 173 offender patients with SSD and no CM, who were admitted to forensic psychiatric inpatient treatment between 1982 and 2016 in Switzerland. Results: Three distinct homogenous classes of patients were identified, two of which were probable to have experienced significant CM. One third of patients with SSD and CM were probable to benefit from inpatient treatment, even surpassing results observable in the group without CM, whereas the other group with SSD and CM was probable to benefit less. Patients with SSD and no CM displayed more psychopathology at first diagnosis and prior to their index offense. Interclass differences in offending behavior were minimal. Conclusions: Offender patients with SSD and CM differ not only from offender patients with SSD and no CM, but also amongst themselves. While some with SSD and CM experience a remission in psychopathology and improve their prognosis for future offending behavior, others do not. Directions for future research on SSD and CM are discussed."
Kawabata 2021,Exploring the Dimensions of Movement-Specific Reinvestment From Personal Characteristics Perspectives.,http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.716945,Kawabata M and Imanaka K,2021,Frontiers in psychology,"The purposes of the present study were three-fold: to examine (a) if the movement-specific reinvestment responses should be represented as two dimensional constructs, (b) whether dichotomization of the movement-specific reinvestment responses are appropriate, and (c) how the two dimensions are associated with relevant psychological concepts. To conduct a comparative examination of the MSRS structure in two Asian samples, participants were 236 Japanese university students (136 men, 100 women; M (age) = 18.0, SD = 1.6) and 328 Singaporeans (167 men, 161 women; M (age) = 21.8, SD = 1.8). After examining the factor structure of the movement-specific reinvestment responses for the first purpose, latent class factor analysis was conducted for both samples for the second purpose. For the third purpose, correlation analysis and mediation analysis were conducted for a part of the Singaporean sample. Through a series of latent class factor analysis, four and three classes were identified for the Japanese and Singaporean samples, respectively. For both samples, the patterns of the item-average scores for the two movement-specific reinvestment dimensions were parallel among the classes. Conscious Motor Processing was positively associated with mental toughness, intrinsic regulation, integrated regulation, mastery-approach and task goal orientations, and dispositional flow, whereas Movement Self-Consciousness was positively related with stress and mastery-avoidance goal orientation. The findings of the study supported (a) the two-dimensional representation of the movement-specific reinvestment responses, but did not fully support (b) the practice of dichotomization of the movement-specific reinvestment responses, and indicated that (c) at the trait level, Conscious Motor Processing and Movement Self-Consciousness were associated with positive and negative psychological constructs, respectively."
Yang 2021,"Stressful Experiences, Connection, and Depressive Symptoms Among Taiwanese Han and Indigenous Youth.",http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.695751,Yang PJ,2021,Frontiers in psychology,"This study examined Taiwanese Han and indigenous (Tayal) youth's experiences of stressful life events, the association between stressful experiences and depressive symptomology, and also the indirect and interactive effects of connection on the relationship between stressful experiences and depressive symptomology. Taiwanese Han (97%) is the majority group, whereas indigenous people make up 2.3% of Taiwan's population. Taiwanese indigenous people have experienced disparities across socio-historical, educational, and economic aspects of their lives. This study included 291 eighth-grade participants (40% from the Tayal tribe, 48.8% female, and M (age) = 13.44). The Han sample in this study all lived in cities, and the Tayal sample all lived in the tribal areas of the Northern Taiwan mountain regions. Person-centered (latent class analyses) and cumulative (sum of items) approaches were used to investigate family and school stressful events, respectively. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted separately for the Han and Tayal participants to examine the role of family and school connection in relation to family and school stressors and depressive symptomology. Our results showed that stressful experiences are clearly linked to depressive symptomology and family connection was important to both Tayal and Han youth in supporting their coping with depressive symptoms. However, Tayal youth might be particularly vulnerable to family stressful events because family stressors disrupted their connection with their parents and thereby minimized the protective function of family relationships. To decrease the likely onset of depression during early adolescence, our results suggest that it is important for parents and other family members to monitor adolescents' daily experiences of stress and provide support when needed. Furthermore, mental health interventions need to be tailored specifically for youth in specific racial, social, and economic contexts. Tayal youth mental health might benefit particularly from increasing school connection and decreasing stresses experienced in family contexts. Implications, limitations, and recommendations for future research are discussed."

Sometimes, qualitative distinctions between trajectories with different ages of onset and/or patterns of remission are made; however, little is known about the predictors and broader clinical meaningfulness of these candidate 'developmental subtypes' of ADHD symptoms. METHODS: We applied latent class growth analysis to data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS; N = 11 316; ages 3, 5, 7, 11 and 14) to evaluate whether developmental trajectories of ADHD symptoms differing in early life predictors could be identified. Our optimal model included six trajectory groups, labelled unaffected (34.9% of the sample), mildly affected (24.1%), subclinical remitting (12.8%), pre-school onset partially remitting (14.1%), developmentally increasing (7.6%) and pre-school onset persistent (6.4%). RESULTS: Factors such as gender, conduct problems, cognitive ability, maternal education, premature birth, peer problems and school readiness scores differentiated between specific ADHD symptom trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings provide preliminary evidence that distinguishing different trajectories of ADHD symptoms could be clinically informative."
Daundasekara 2021,The mediating effect of parenting stress and couple relationship quality on the association between material hardship trajectories and maternal mental health status.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.04.058,Daundasekara SS and Schuler BR and Beauchamp JES and Hernandez DC,2021,Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Household material hardships could have a negative impact on maternal mental health. Understanding mechanisms by which material hardship trajectories affect maternal depression and anxiety could aid health care professionals and researchers to design better interventions to improve mental health outcomes among mothers. METHODS: The study identified family-level mechanisms by which material hardship trajectories affect maternal depression and anxiety using Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study data (n = 1,645). Latent growth mixture modelling was used to identify latent classes of material hardship trajectories at Years-1, -3, and -5. Parenting stress and couple relationship quality was measured at Year-9. The outcome measures included maternal depression and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) at Year-15 based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview - Short Form. RESULTS: Parenting stress mediated the association between low-increasing hardship (b = 0.020, 95% confidence interval (CI):0.003, 0.043) and maternal depression. Parenting stress also mediated the association between high-increasing hardship (b = 0.043, 95% CI:0.004, 0.092), high decreasing hardship (b = 0.034, 95% CI=0.001, 0.072), and low-increasing (b = 0.034, 95% CI:0.007, 0.066) and maternal GAD. In all models, current material hardship was directly related to maternal depression (b = 0.188, 95% CI:0.134, 0.242) and GAD (b = 0.174, 95% CI:0.091, 0.239). LIMITATIONS: Study results need to be interpreted with caution as the FFCWS oversampled non-marital births as part of the original study design. CONCLUSIONS: While current material hardship appears to be more related to maternal mental health, prior material hardship experiences contribute to greater parenting stress which places mothers at risk for experiencing depression and GAD later on."

METHODS: Bereaved adults (n = 138) were assessed at 8, 21, 32, 67, and 90 months after the sudden death of a spouse or close relative. We used latent class growth analysis to identify the longitudinal trajectories of grief assessed using the Inventory for Complicated Grief. To validate the trajectory that corresponded to prolonged grief, we examined the baseline predictors of these trajectories and their relationship with functional impairment. RESULTS: We found three distinct trajectories of grief reactions. One of these trajectories (13.8%) showed high and sustained grief reactions that persisted for almost 7.5 years after the death. Participants with prolonged grief showed greater functional impairment [relative risk ratio (RRR) = 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.70 to -0.97; p = 0.02] and higher self-reported depression (RRR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.96; p = 0.001) than participants whose grief reactions subsided over time. The original PCBD (requiring 6 criterion C symptoms) criteria correctly identified cases (57.9-94.7%) with perfect specificity (100%) but low to high sensitivity (5.6-81.3%); however, its sensitivity increased when revising criterion C to require ⩾3 (45.5-94.1%). The dimensional approach showed high sensitivity (0.50-1) and specificity (0.787-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: We recommend revisions to the PCBD criteria, which are overly restrictive and may exclude cases with clinically significant grief-related distress and impairment. In the meantime, clinicians need to monitor grief symptoms over time using available dimensional approaches to reduce the burden of grief."

We aimed to explore whether this heterogeneous course of MCI may be predicted by the presence of Lewy body (LB) symptoms in a prospectively-recruited longitudinal cohort of MCI with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB) and Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD). METHODS: A prospective cohort (n = 76) aged ⩾60 years underwent detailed assessment after recent MCI diagnosis, and were followed up annually with repeated neuropsychological testing and clinical review of cognitive status and LB symptoms. Latent class mixture modelling identified data-driven sub-groups with distinct trajectories of global cognitive function. RESULTS: Three distinct trajectories were identified in the full cohort: slow/stable progression (46%), intermediate progressive decline (41%) and a small group with a much faster decline (13%). The presence of LB symptomology, and visual hallucinations in particular, predicted decline v. a stable cognitive trajectory. With time zeroed on study end (death, dementia or withdrawal) where available (n = 39), the same subgroups were identified. Adjustment for baseline functioning obscured the presence of any latent classes, suggesting that baseline function is an important parameter in prospective decline. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight some potential signals for impending decline in MCI; poorer baseline function and the presence of probable LB symptoms - particularly visual hallucinations. Identifying people with a rapid decline is important but our findings are preliminary given the modest cohort size."
Williams 2021,Community stakeholder preferences for evidence-based practice implementation strategies in behavioral health: a best-worst scaling choice experiment.,http://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03072-x,Williams NJ and Candon M and Stewart RE and Byeon YV and Bewtra M and Buttenheim AM and Zentgraf K and Comeau C and Shoyinka S and Beidas RS,2021,BMC psychiatry,"BACKGROUND: Community behavioral health clinicians, supervisors, and administrators play an essential role in implementing new psychosocial evidence-based practices (EBP) for patients receiving psychiatric care; however, little is known about these stakeholders' values and preferences for implementation strategies that support EBP use, nor how best to elicit, quantify, or segment their preferences. This study sought to quantify these stakeholders' preferences for implementation strategies and to identify segments of stakeholders with distinct preferences using a rigorous choice experiment method called best-worst scaling. METHODS: A total of 240 clinicians, 74 clinical supervisors, and 29 administrators employed within clinics delivering publicly-funded behavioral health services in a large metropolitan behavioral health system participated in a best-worst scaling choice experiment. Participants evaluated 14 implementation strategies developed through extensive elicitation and pilot work within the target system. Preference weights were generated for each strategy using hierarchical Bayesian estimation. Latent class analysis identified segments of stakeholders with unique preference profiles. RESULTS: On average, stakeholders preferred two strategies significantly more than all others-compensation for use of EBP per session and compensation for preparation time to use the EBP (P < .05); two strategies were preferred significantly less than all others-performance feedback via email and performance feedback via leaderboard (P < .05). However, latent class analysis identified four distinct segments of stakeholders with unique preferences: Segment 1 (n = 121, 35%) strongly preferred financial incentives over all other approaches and included more administrators; Segment 2 (n = 80, 23%) preferred technology-based strategies and was younger, on average; Segment 3 (n = 52, 15%) preferred an improved waiting room to enhance client readiness, strongly disliked any type of clinical consultation, and had the lowest participation in local EBP training initiatives; Segment 4 (n = 90, 26%) strongly preferred clinical consultation strategies and included more clinicians in substance use clinics. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of four heterogeneous subpopulations within this large group of clinicians, supervisors, and administrators suggests optimal implementation may be achieved through targeted strategies derived via elicitation of stakeholder preferences. Best-worst scaling is a feasible and rigorous method for eliciting stakeholders' implementation preferences and identifying subpopulations with unique preferences in behavioral health settings."
Gao 2021b,Trajectories of depression and anxiety in Chinese high school freshmen: Associations with Internet addiction.,http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.074,Gao T and Qin Z and Hu Y and Fei J and Cao R and Liang L and Li C and Mei S and Meng X,2021,Journal of affective disorders,"BACKGROUND: Most previous studies focused on the associations of depression and anxiety with Internet addiction (IA) have used variable-centered approaches. This study aims to explore the distinct developmental trajectories of depression and anxiety, and their association with IA based on person-centered approaches. METHODS: A total of 437 Chinese high school freshmen at the baseline were followed across one year. Latent class growth analysis (LCGA) and growth mixture modeling (GMM) were used to identify the heterogeneity of individual trajectories of depression and anxiety. RESULTS: For depression, there were three distinct trajectories identified, namely, the escalating group (n=60, 13.7%), recovery group (n=31, 7.1%), and the low-stable group (n=346, 79.2%). For anxiety, the subgroups consisted of the escalating group (n=50, 11.4%), the recovery group (n=34, 7.8%), and the low-stable group (n=353, 80.8%). The probability of IA in the depression low-stable group was significantly smaller compared to those in either the recovery group (χ(2)=10.794, P=0.001) or the escalating group (χ(2)=19.314, P<0.001). The probability of IA in the anxiety low-stable group was found to be significantly smaller than that in the recovery group (χ(2)=17.359, P<0.001) and the escalating group (χ(2)=7.752, P=0.005). LIMITATIONS: The sample was limited to students from one specific high school and had a one-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study suggest the necessity of early prevention and intervention strategies for those students with depression and anxiety, which are at elevated risk of developing IA."

No previous study has examined whether the latent patterns of aggression and psychological distress are the same in male and female AAS users. Multigroup latent class analysis (MLCA) can be used to classify individuals into groups based on their responses on a set of variables, and to investigate measurement invariance across subgroups. We therefore conducted a MLCA to identify discrete subgroups of aggression and psychological distress in AAS users, and used measurement invariance to examine whether the identified subgroups can be applied to both sexes. We also examined the relationship between sex and subgroup belongingness. The sample comprised 206 AAS users (females = 58.30%) aged 14-56 (mean = 26.86, SD = 7.12) years. They completed questionnaires assessing demographics, AAS use, aggression, and psychological distress. Based on the MLCA, five subgroups were identified: high aggression moderate distress users (HAMoD: 07.63%), moderate aggression distress users (18.64%), moderate direct aggression-mild indirect aggression moderate distress users (22.95%), mild direct aggression-moderate indirect aggression-distress users (11.71%), and low aggression mild distress users (LAMiD: 39.06%). Although a homogenous five-class solution was the best model for both sexes, sex was significantly associated with the probability of subgroup membership. In particular, members of the HAMoD subgroup were more likely to be male whereas members of the LAMiD subgroup were more likely to be female. Our study provides novel empirical evidence of the idiosyncratic patterns of aggression and psychological distress among male and female AAS users."

The current study aims to use machine learning algorithms to analyze microarray data to identify clusters with relatively homogeneous clinical features. Methods: The whole-genome gene expression microarray data were used to predict communication quotient (SCQ) scores against all probes to select differential expression regions (DERs). Gene set enrichment analysis was performed for DERs with a fold-change >2 to identify hub pathways that play a role in the severity of social communication deficits inherent to ASD. We then used two machine learning methods, random forest classification (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), to identify two clusters using DERs. Finally, we evaluated how accurately the clusters predicted language impairment. Results: A total of 191 DERs were initially identified, and 54 of them with a fold-change >2 were selected for the pathway analysis. Cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolisms pathways appear to act as hubs that connect other trait-associated pathways to influence the severity of social communication deficits inherent to ASD. Both RF and SVM algorithms can yield a classification accuracy level >90% when all 191 DERs were analyzed. The ASD subtypes defined by the presence of language impairment, a strong indicator for prognosis, can be predicted by transcriptomic profiles associated with social communication deficits and cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism. Conclusion: The results suggest that both RF and SVM are acceptable options for machine learning algorithms to identify AD subgroups characterized by clinical homogeneity related to prognosis."
Maltman 2021,"The Phenotypic Profile Associated With the FMR1 Premutation in Women: An Investigation of Clinical-Behavioral, Social-Cognitive, and Executive Abilities.",http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.718485,Maltman N and Guilfoyle J and Nayar K and Martin GE and Winston M and Lau JCY and Bush L and Patel S and Lee M and Sideris J and Hall DA and Zhou L and Sharp K and Berry-Kravis E and Losh M,2021,Frontiers in psychiatry,"The FMR1 gene in its premutation (PM) state has been linked to a range of clinical and subclinical phenotypes among FMR1 PM carriers, including some subclinical traits associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study attempted to further characterize the phenotypic profile associated with the FMR1 PM by studying a battery of assessments examining clinical-behavioral traits, social-cognitive, and executive abilities in women carrying the FMR1 PM, and associations with FMR1-related variability. Participants included 152 female FMR1 PM carriers and 75 female controls who were similar in age and IQ, and screened for neuromotor impairments or signs of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. The phenotypic battery included assessments of ASD-related personality and language (i.e., pragmatic) traits, symptoms of anxiety and depression, four different social-cognitive tasks that tapped the ability to read internal states and emotions based on different cues (e.g., facial expressions, biological motion, and complex social scenes), and a measure of executive function. Results revealed a complex phenotypic profile among the PM carrier group, where subtle differences were observed in pragmatic language, executive function, and social-cognitive tasks that involved evaluating basic emotions and trustworthiness. The PM carrier group also showed elevated rates of ASD-related personality traits. In contrast, PM carriers performed similarly to controls on social-cognitive tasks that involved reliance on faces and biological motion. The PM group did not differ from controls on self-reported depression or anxiety symptoms. Using latent profile analysis, we observed three distinct subgroups of PM carriers who varied considerably in their performance across tasks. Among PM carriers, CGG repeat length was a significant predictor of pragmatic language violations. Results suggest a nuanced phenotypic profile characterized by subtle differences in select clinical-behavioral, social-cognitive, and executive abilities associated with the FMR1 PM in women."

A Way to Understand Long-COVID19 Fatigue.,http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.735784,Murga I and Aranburu L and Gargiulo PA and Gómez Esteban JC and Lafuente JV,2021,Frontiers in psychiatry,"The aim of present paper is to identify clinical phenotypes in a cohort of patients affected of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Ninety-one patients and 22 healthy controls were studied with the following questionnaires, in addition to medical history: visual analogical scale for fatigue and pain, DePaul questionnaire (post-exertional malaise, immune, neuroendocrine), Pittsburgh sleep quality index, COMPASS-31 (dysautonomia), Montreal cognitive assessment, Toulouse-Piéron test (attention), Hospital Anxiety and Depression test and Karnofsky scale. Co-morbidities and drugs-intake were also recorded. A hierarchical clustering with clinical results was performed. Final study group was made up of 84 patients, mean age 44.41 ± 9.37 years (66 female/18 male) and 22 controls, mean age 45 ± 13.15 years (14 female/8 male). Patients meet diagnostic criteria of Fukuda-1994 and Carruthers-2011. Clustering analysis identify five phenotypes. Two groups without fibromyalgia were differentiated by various levels of anxiety and depression (13 and 20 patients). The other three groups present fibromyalgia plus a patient without it, but with high scores in pain scale, they were segregated by prevalence of dysautonomia (17), neuroendocrine (15), and immunological affectation (19). Regarding gender, women showed higher scores than men in cognition, pain level and depressive syndrome. Mathematical tools are a suitable approach to objectify some elusive features in order to understand the syndrome. Clustering unveils phenotypes combining fibromyalgia with varying degrees of dysautonomia, neuroendocrine or immune features and absence of fibromyalgia with high or low levels of anxiety-depression. There is no a specific phenotype for women or men."
Paschke 2021,ICD-11-Based Assessment of Social Media Use Disorder in Adolescents: Development and Validation of the Social Media Use Disorder Scale for Adolescents.,http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.661483,Paschke K and Austermann MI and Thomasius R,2021,Frontiers in psychiatry,"Background: A problematic social media use (PSMU) in adolescents is a rising phenomenon often associated with higher perception of psychological stress and comorbid psychiatric disorders like depression. Since the ICD-11 introduced the very first internet-use related disorders, criteria for gaming (and online gambling) disorder can now be transferred to assess social media use disorder (SMUD). Therefore, the development and validation of a self-rating screening instrument for SMUD is of value to researchers and clinicians. Method: The previously validated ICD-11-based Gaming Disorder Scale for Adolescents (GADIS-A) was adapted to measure SMUD (Social Media Use Disorder Scale for Adolescents, SOMEDIS-A). A representative sample of 931 adolescents aged 10 to 17 years and a respective parent participated in an online study. Item structure was evaluated by factorial analyses. Validated DSM-5-based instruments to assess PSMU by self- and parental ratings (SMDS, SMDS-P), adolescent depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), and stress perception (PSS-10) as well as single items on time spent with social media (SM, frequency and duration) were applied to assess criterion validity. Discrimination between pathological and non-pathological users was examined based on ROC analyses retrieved cut-off values and the results of a latent profile analysis. Results: The new scale is best described by two factors reflecting cognitive-behavioral symptoms and associated negative consequences. The internal consistency was good to excellent. The SOMEDIS-A-sum score was positively correlated with PSMU, depression, and stress scores as well as the time spent with SM in a moderately to highly significant manner. Thus, good to excellent criterion validity is suggested. Conclusions: SOMEDIS-A is the first successfully validated instrument to assess SMUD in adolescents based on the ICD-11 criteria of GD. Thus, it can support early detection in order to prevent symptom aggravation, chronification, and secondary comorbidities. It can contribute to the development of a standardized conceptualization and its two-factorial structure offers promising new insights into the evaluation of SM usage patterns. Further examination including clinical validation is desirable."
Gamache 2021,A Proposed Classification of ICD-11 Severity Degrees of Personality Pathology Using the Self and Interpersonal Functioning Scale.,http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.628057,Gamache D and Savard C and Leclerc P and Payant M and Berthelot N and Côté A and Faucher J and Lampron M and Lemieux R and Mayrand K and Nolin MC and Tremblay M,2021,Frontiers in psychiatry,"Background: The 11th version of the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) has adopted a dimensional approach to personality disorder (PD) nosology. Notably, it includes an assessment of PD degree of severity, which can be classified according to five categories. To date, there is no gold standard measure for assessing degree of PD severity based on the ICD-11 model, and there are no empirically-based anchor points to delineate the proposed categories. With the operationalization of PD degrees of severity in the ICD-11 PD model now being closely aligned with Criterion A of the DSM-5 Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), sharing a focus on self and interpersonal dysfunction, self-report instruments developed for the latter model might prove useful as screening tools to determine degrees of severity in the former. Methods: The Self and Interpersonal Functioning Scale, a brief validated self-report questionnaire originally designed to assess level of personality pathology according to the AMPD framework, was used to derive anchor points to delineate the five severity degrees from the ICD-11 PD model. Data from five clinical and non-clinical samples (total N = 2,240) allowed identifying anchor points for classification, based on Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis, Latent Class Analysis, and data distribution statistics. Categories were validated using multiple indices pertaining to externalizing and internalizing symptoms relevant to PD. Results: Analyses yielded the following anchor points for PD degrees of severity: No PD = 0-1.04; Personality Difficulty = 1.05-1.29; Mild PD = 1.30-1.89; Moderate PD = 1.90-2.49; and Severe PD = 2.50 and above. A clear gradient of severity across the five categories was observed in all samples. A high number of significant contrasts among PD categories were also observed on external variables, consistent with the ICD-11 PD degree of severity operationalization. Conclusions: The present study provides potentially useful guidelines to determine severity of personality pathology based on the ICD-11 model. The use of a brief self-report questionnaire as a screening tool for assessing PD degrees of severity should be seen as a time-efficient support for clinical decision and treatment planning."
